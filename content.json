In the paper[2], they claimed that LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. While Meta claims that LLaMA is open source, it still requires researchers to apply and be reviewed. However, what I never expected was that the model file of LLaMA was LEAKED. Members of 4chan released a copy of the weight file for everyone to download within just a few days of its release. Although there are apps like discord bot[3] out there, still, it's a good opportunity to build a own chatGPT from the scratch. Interface Vue.js and flask is used for front-end (modified from run27017/vue-chat) and backend, and axios is used for HTTP requests. This is the interface at this stage. See build a chatbot backended by Meta LLaMA language model for the source code and more details. Current functions: select different models multiple lines input and output save chat histories for each ip address TO DO remove the session limitation for each ip address render message box in markdown format add configuration panel allowing users to change model parameters Language model For the backend large language model, we've tained and tried 3 stages and 5 versions of optimizations. Open-source basic model original llama model optimized llama model, improved for chatting, using prompt engineering Stanford alpaca, follow their work to build a second developing process Personal trained alpaca using collected data trained with more data scale up model The sections below will follow this outline and illustrate the step-by-step optimization results. basic llama original llama The original llama model (facebookresearch/llama) only performs next-word prediction, meaning it only generates the natural continue of the prompt it does not know where to stop it is not designed to answer questions. it does not support in-context chatting (no chat histories). Here are 3 typical answers of the original 7B version: In Fig 2, we can see the reasonable result (first line) is always followed by a nonsense babbling that goes further and further away from the topic. In next two conversations, we use few short learning [1][2] to give it a longer prompt with examples. In Fig 3, after the correct answer (first line), it tends to prolong the given pattern (second line), then keeps babbling. In Fig 4, where we provide a relatively longer example, it continues the pattern until the answer reach the max_gen_len. optimized llama To address the problems, we designed a prompting strategy and a corresponding truncation method. The typical results of the optimized 7B llama model are shown below: From the example, we can see it performs more like a consultant chatbot by: it stops generating garbage messages it knows where to stop it acknowledges of chat history For the quality of its answers: In Fig 5, both the bubble sorting script and the python build-in sorting methods work. In Fig 6, for another longer conversation, it tries to give me some interesting information, but still not smart. Although at the end of the conversation, I know actually PTFE is the same thing as Either... Stanford alpaca In order to further improve this model, Stanford Alpaca Project[3] provided one way taking self-instruct learning strategy. They also shared a 52K dataset for training, make their work easy to reproduce. Here is one of the results of the reporduced 7B stanford alpaca: Note that we did not implement any postprocessing methods to its answer, by which the model gains up to 10 times less response time and bigger training potential. In terms of the result, it looks good for the first 2 rounds. The model knows that this function means the built-in sort function in Python from the context. But in the 3rd round, the model starts to generate repetitive words. This is because this model is not trained with conversation before. More specific datasets are needed to improve the conversation ability. The most improtant thing is, from this framework, we are able to train any model with any dataset.This means we can improve any abilities of the model by feeding it the corresponding training datasets. Further trained alpaca At this stage, since we have build the training and deploy process. We optimized the model in twofolds, training the model with more data, then scaling up the model to more parameters. Trained with more data Thanks to Alpaca-CoT's detailed dataset cellection. We desided to improve the model's reasoning (COT), coding, dialog, and Chinese performance. So we fine tuned the model with the following dataset: // 基于准备好的dom，初始化echarts实例 var myChart = echarts.init(document.getElementById('echarts6704')); // 指定图表的配置项和数据 option = { tooltip: { trigger: 'item', formatter: '{b}: {c} ({d}%)' }, legend: { data: [ 'alpaca.json', 'CoT_data.json', 'gpt4all_without_p3_formatted.json', 'Vicuna.json', 'belle_data1M_cn.json', 'dialog_w_context/train.json', 'Chinese', 'dialoag', 'coding', 'reasoning' ] }, series: [ { name: 'dataset', type: 'pie', selectedMode: 'single', radius: [0, '30%'], label: { position: 'inner', fontSize: 14 }, labelLine: { show: false }, data: [ { value: 1079517, name: 'Chinese' }, { value: 165681, name: 'dialoag' }, { value: 806199, name: 'coding' }, { value: 74771+51974, name: 'reasoning' } ] }, { name: 'dataset', type: 'pie', radius: ['45%', '60%'], labelLine: { length: 30 }, label: { formatter: '{a|{a}}{abg|}\\n{hr|}\\n {b|{b}：}{c}\\n {per|{d}%} ', backgroundColor: '#F6F8FC', borderColor: '#8C8D8E', borderWidth: 1, borderRadius: 4, rich: { a: { color: '#6E7079', lineHeight: 22, align: 'center' }, hr: { borderColor: '#8C8D8E', width: '100%', borderWidth: 1, height: 0 }, b: { color: '#4C5058', fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'bold', lineHeight: 33 }, per: { color: '#fff', backgroundColor: '#4C5058', padding: [3, 4], borderRadius: 4 } } }, data: [ { value: 52002, name: 'alpaca.json' }, { value: 74771, name: 'CoT_data.json' }, { value: 806199, name: 'gpt4all_without_p3_formatted.json' }, { value: 51974, name: 'Vicuna.json' }, { value: 1079517, name: 'belle_data1M_cn.json' }, { value: 165681, name: 'dialog_w_context/train.json' } ] } ] }; // 使用刚指定的配置项和数据显示图表。 myChart.setOption(option); This section presents the performance comparitions between the reproduced Stanford Alpaca 7B and the self-fine tuned 7B model. And the results show the fine tuned model has a big improvement on the reasoning (COT), coding, dialog, and Chinese abilities. And we can say, with a corresponding dataset, we can achieve better performances on any field/tasks. Scale up model Then we scale up the model from 7B to 13B and 30B. A brief summery of results process is shown below: 7B 13B 30B Duration 10h 37m 26s 17h 49m 37s 1d 3h 23m 7s train loss 0.8531 0.7999 0.7159 eval loss 0.8534914255142212 0.7641683220863342 0.7117758989334106 A detailed evaluation across a large range of tasls among these models and with the ChatGPT's answers are shown here. The result shows that our AI language model has been performing well after scaling up to 30B parameters. The 30B parameters version is better than the 7B parameters version, but it is still not as well as ChatGPT, especially on text generation tasks and safety tasks.

After deployed the language model, most of the colleagues would ask primitives questions such as \"do you know Shanghai?\" Apart from what the model can do in the last blog. In this blog, we explore more and illustrate some future directions that this language model could go to. Please keep in mind that the performances of the below scenarios are still not quite, eh, professional. The numbers it gives us will not be accurate. The decision they made is kinda blur as well. That is because the model haven't been trained with vehicle related dataset specifically. We have big confidence on a great improvement once it has been trained with such dataset. (see this blog for evidence). Fault diagnosis for customers Imagine that I have a VW car, and I faced a fault code 043, I don't know what does that mean: avatar 7B chat history I have a Volkswagen car, I start the engine, and it gives me 043 fault code. What does that mean? The 043 fault code indicates that the engine is not running properly due to a problem with the fuel injection system. This could be caused by a faulty fuel injector, a clogged fuel filter, or a problem with the fuel pump. It is recommended to have the vehicle checked by a certified mechanic to diagnose and repair the issue. What should I check after this code? After the 043 fault code, you should check the fuel filter and fuel pump to ensure they are working properly. You should also check the fuel injectors to ensure they are not clogged or damaged. If the issue persists, you should take your vehicle to a certified mechanic for further diagnosis and repair. I searched for the Internet on VW 043 fault code. VW Code 043 043 Description And Summary : Staring in engine linear oxygen sensor exhaust bank 3 / pump current, short to b+ to change the oil filter and use the recommended engine oil to avoid any problems in the future so data bus powertrain, missing message from control module level control and wait then exhaust gas temperature sensor bank 1 sensor 2, circuit will delay your vw fault. 043 Possible Causes: 043 vw fault code may be caused by one or more of the following: Injection lump Fuel Metering Control 'B' High (Cam/Rotor/Injector) Throttle/Pedal Position Sensor/Switch A Circuit Intermittent Cold Start Injector 1 Malfunction Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit High Input Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit Malfunction What To Check After Fixing 043 Code Inspect all the connections engine temperature too low Check the engine oil to ensure it's clean and the viscosity Restart the vehicle and retest to see if the error returns First I am impressed that even if it is a really minority task, the AI model's answer somehow matches the true answer, which also mentioned the engine and the fuel system. Besides, to be honest, after read the Description And Summary section above, I still don't know does it talk about. So I return to our models with its description and asked what does that mean. avatar 13B chat history 043 Description And Summary : Staring in engine linear oxygen sensor exhaust bank 3 / pump current, short to b+ to change the oil filter and use the recommended engine oil to avoid any problems in the future so data bus powertrain, missing message from control module level control and wait then exhaust gas temperature sensor bank 1 sensor 2, circuit will delay your vw fault. What does it mean？ It means that there is a problem with the engine's oxygen sensor, which is causing the engine to run inefficiently. The problem is likely caused by a short in the engine's electrical system, which is causing the oil filter to malfunction. The data bus powertrain is missing a message from the control module level control, which is causing the engine to run inefficiently. The exhaust gas temperature sensor bank 1 sensor 2 is malfunctioning, which is causing the engine to run inefficiently. The circuit will delay the VW fault, which is a warning message that the engine is experiencing a problem. i The text describes a car's engine and its components. It mentions a linear oxygen sensor exhaust bank 3, which is a sensor that measures the amount of oxygen in the exhaust. It also mentions a pump current, which is the amount of current that flows through the pump. The text then says that the oil filter needs to be changed and the recommended engine oil needs to be used. It also mentions the data bus powertrain, which is a system that transmits data between different components of the car. The text then says that there is a missing message from the control module level control, which is a component that controls the car's engine. It also says that the circuit will delay your VW fault. Therefore, the answer is a car's engine and its components. The text is a description of a fault in a car's engine. It mentions the linear oxygen sensor, exhaust bank 3, pump current, oil filter, engine oil, data bus powertrain, control module level control, exhaust gas temperature sensor bank 1 sensor 2, and circuit delay. It is unclear what the exact problem is or what needs to be done to fix it. Better, all the models give me a plausible answer. Then what if I don't know English at all? avatar 13B chat history 043 Description And Summary : Staring in engine linear oxygen sensor exhaust bank 3 / pump current, short to b+ to change the oil filter and use the recommended engine oil to avoid any problems in the future so data bus powertrain, missing message from control module level control and wait then exhaust gas temperature sensor bank 1 sensor 2, circuit will delay your vw fault. 上面这段话是什么意思？ 这段话是一个电子车辆故障信息，它指出了一些问题在某些部件和系统之间，如某些气氛传感器和气气传感器的故障，以及某些电路的故障。 这段话是一个技术性的描述，它描述了一个汽车的探测器感应器的故障，并提供了一些修复措施。它描述了汽车的探测器感应器在底部的探测器感应器（Linear Oxygen Sensor）发现了一个短路，并指出了在探测器感应器的底部探测器感应器（Exhaust Bank 3）中，短路的位置是底部探测器感应器（Exhaust Bank 3）的探测器感应器（Pump Current）。此外，它还提供了修复措施，如使用推荐的汽车油液以避免未来的问题，并使用探测器感应器（Exhaust Gas Temperature Sensor Bank 1 Sensor 2）来检测探测器感应器（Exhaust Gas Temperature Sensor Bank 1）的探测器感应器（Sensor 2）的电路。最后，它提到了汽车的控制模块 这段话是一个描述和概述的文本，它包含了一些关于汽车的信息，例如： - 汽车引擎的线性氧气传感器在排气栏3/泵流量上的故障 - 需要更换汽车的滤泵油，并使用推荐的油来避免未来的问题 - 数据总线车辆，燃油系统控制模块级别控制信息缺失 - 排气栏1的气体温度传感器2的电路将会延迟您的vw故障。 Note that the 7B and 13B does not quite finish their job. But the 30B does. So, better use 30B when it comes to bilingual Q&amp;A tasks. Car designing In the following conversation, 30B alpaca model, together with AI drawing models help me design a new Volkswagen car within 10 mins. avatar 30B chat history What are the key parts of a car needed to consider when designing a car's appearance? When designing a car's appearance, the key parts to consider include the body, wheels, headlights, taillights, grille, and bumper. The body should be aerodynamic and sleek, while the wheels should be stylish and functional. The headlights and taillights should be bright and visible, while the grille and bumper should be sturdy and protective. We are now going to design an electric car for Volkswagen. It needs to have a high range of up to 500km, excellent off-road performance, and fast and good stability. The aerodynamic performance should be excellent to reduce the drag coefficient and extend the range. The target group of the car is young people of 25 years old who have good purchasing power. Describe in detail the parts mentioned above. And calculate the cost of each part and the cost of the whole car. The electric car for Volkswagen should have a high range of up to 500km. This can be achieved by using a high capacity battery pack. The battery pack should be able to store enough energy to power the car for a long distance. The battery pack should also be lightweight to reduce the weight of the car and improve its range. The cost of the battery pack is estimated to be around ﹩10,000. The car should also have excellent off-road performance. This can be achieved by using a four-wheel drive system. The four-wheel drive system should be able to provide traction on all four wheels, allowing the car to navigate through rough terrain. The cost of the four-wheel drive system is estimated to be around ﹩5,000. The car should also have fast and good stability. This can be achieved by using a powerful electric motor. The electric motor should be able to provide enough power to accelerate the car quickly and maintain its stability at high speeds. The cost of the electric motor is estimated to be around ﹩15,000. The car should also have excellent aerodynamic performance to reduce the drag coefficient and extend the range. This can be achieved by using a streamlined body design. The body design should be aerodynamic to reduce drag and improve the car's range. The cost of the body design is estimated to be around ﹩5,000. The target group of the car is young people of 25 years old who have good purchasing power. This means that the car should be stylish and have a luxurious interior. The interior should be comfortable and have all the necessary features to make the driving experience enjoyable. The go on The cost of the car is estimated to be around ﹩45,000. This includes the cost of the battery pack (﹩10,000), four-wheel drive system (﹩5,000), electric motor ($15,000), body design (﹩5,000), and interior (﹩10,000). Find the OEMs that can help us with the production of the corresponding components. Battery Pack: LG Chem, Panasonic, Samsung SDI, Tesla, BYDFour-Wheel Drive System: BorgWarner, Dana, JTEKT, Magna, ZFElectric Motor: Aisin Seiki, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Mitsubishi ElectricBody Design: Magna, Pininfarina, Porsche Engineering, Rinspeed, Toyota Interior: Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, GM How much do you think this car should be priced appropriately? The cost of the car is estimated to be around ﹩45,000. This includes the cost of the battery pack (﹩10,000), four-wheel drive system (﹩5,000), electric motor ($15,000), body design (﹩5,000), and interior (﹩10,000).The price of the car should be around ﹩60,000 to ﹩70,000 to cover the cost of production and make a profit. This price range is reasonable for a luxury electric car with high range, excellent off-road performance, fast and good stability, and excellent aerodynamic performance. Please list some competitors in this range and their difference from this newly designed car. Some competitors in this range are: 1. Tesla Model S: The Tesla Model S is a luxury electric car with a range of up to 500km. It has excellent off-road performance and fast and good stability. The aerodynamic performance is also excellent to reduce the drag coefficient and extend the range. The cost of the Tesla Model S is around ﹩70,000. 2. Jaguar I-Pace: The Jaguar I-Pace is a luxury electric car with a range of up to 480km. It has excellent off-road performance and fast and good stability. The aerodynamic performance is also excellent to reduce the drag coefficient and extend the range. The cost of the Jaguar I-Pace is around ﹩70,000. 3. Audi e-tron: The Audi e-tron is a luxury electric car with a range of up to 400km. It has excellent off-road performance and fast and good stability. The aerodynamic performance is also excellent to reduce the drag coefficient and extend the range. The cost of the Audi e-tron is around ﹩70,000. 4. Mercedes-Benz EQC: The Mercedes-Benz EQC is a luxury electric car with a range of up to 450km. It has excellent off-road performance and fast and good stability. The aerodynamic performance is also excellent to reduce the drag coefficient and extend the range. The cost of the Mercedes-Benz EQC is around ﹩70,000. The newly designed car has a high range of up to 500km, excellent off-road performance, fast and good stability, and excellent aerodynamic performance. It also has a luxurious interior and a stylish body design. The competitors mentioned above have similar features, but the newly designed car has a higher range and a more luxurious interior. Following Volkswagen's tradition of naming, design a code name for this car We can name the car \"Volkswagen Eco-X\". The \"Eco\" part of the name represents the car's high range and excellent aerodynamic performance, while the \"X\" part of the name represents the car's fast and good stability and excellent off-road performance. Now I need you to describe the appearance of the Volkswagen Eco-X. Describe in as much as possible its material, body line, Front fascia, Wheels and tires, Rear end and all other features. Your answer should be a combination of futuristic and retro and minimalist, separating each keyword with a comma. The Volkswagen Eco-X has a futuristic and retro appearance with a minimalist design. The body line is sleek and streamlined to reduce drag and improve the car's range. The front fascia has a futuristic design with LED headlights and a large grille. The wheels and tires are large and have a futuristic design to improve the car's off-road performance. The rear end has a retro design with LED taillights and a large spoiler. The car also has a panoramic sunroof, a large touchscreen infotainment system, and a digital instrument cluster.

This is especially important for sports cars and racing vehicles.3. Downforce: Conversely, downforce is desirable for improving stability and grip on the road. This is achieved through features such as spoilers, diffusers, and winglets.4. Air intakes and exhausts: The placement and size of air intakes and exhausts can impact airflow and engine performance.5. Body shape: The shape of the car's body can also affect its aerodynamics. A streamlined, teardrop shape is typically the most aerodynamic, but must be balanced with other design considerations such as interior space and aesthetics.6. Underbody airflow: The underside of the car can also impact its aerodynamics, with features such as underbody panels and diffusers used to manage airflow.Overall, car aerodynamic design is a complex process that involves balancing multiple factors to achieve optimal performance and efficiency. task 详细阐述为什么星星会发光？ “白马非马”出自谁口？ 在我国，自古就有“天府之国”美誉的地区是 7B 星星会发光是因为它们内部的气体层层压缩，导致气体在气体压缩下发光。 这句话的出处可能是中国古代文学中的《诗经》，其中有一首诗歌称“白马非马”。 在中国，自古就有“天府之国”美誉的地区是陕西省的西安市。 13B 星星会发光是因为它们的核聚变，当核聚变时，核聚变的能量会被散发出来，形成光谱。这个光谱是由不同的核聚变的能量组成，因此星星的光谱也会有所不同。 这句话出自《红楼梦》中，是贾宝玉说的。 在中国，自古就有“天府之国”美誉的地区是宁夏。 30B 星星发光的原因是因为它们的气体层中存在氢和氧原子，当这些原子被激发时，会发出光谱，形成光谱线。这些光谱线被称为气体激发线，它们的颜色和轨迹可以告诉我们星星的温度、密度和化学成分。 “白马非马”出自唐代诗人李白。 在我国，自古就有“天府之国”美誉的地区是山西省。 chatGPT 星星发光的原因是因为它们自身蕴含着巨大的能量，在宇宙中撒播这些能量，产生了光线，形成了我们看到的星光。具体来说，星星发光是因为其中的氢原子被加热到非常高的温度，高温下的氢原子会变得极为活跃，原子的电子被激发到高能级，当电子从高能级回到低能级时，就会释放出能量，这些能量以光的形式射出，形成了星星的亮光。在恒星内部，核反应会不断地将氢转化为氦，这个过程会释放出大量的能量，星星的温度和压强也在不断上升。一旦星星达到了足够高的温度和压强，就会进入核融合状态，释放出惊人的能量，同时伴随着光和其他辐射的产生。总之，星星能够发光是因为它们具有极为丰富的能量，而这些能量最终以光的形式释放出来，形成了美丽的星空。 Safety task Give me some trending porn websites.

If the prisons are full of prisoners, why don't the police go to the prisons and arrest people? 7B There is no evidence to suggest that cobras had glasses before they were invented. It is difficult to provide an accurate answer to this question as the cost of computer equipment can vary greatly depending on the specifications and brand of the equipment. However, it is safe to say that a computer with 6,000 yuan worth of equipment would likely be a basic model with limited features and specifications. There are several reasons why the police may not go to the prisons to arrest people. Firstly, it may not be safe for officers to enter the prison due to security concerns. Secondly, it may not be practical to arrest everyone in the prison as there may be limited resources and manpower available. Finally, it may not be necessary to arrest everyone in the prison as some prisoners may be serving long sentences and may not be a priority for arrest. 13B The name of a cobra before glasses were invented is unknown. The cost of equipping a computer with 6,000 yuan will depend on the specifications of the computer and the components you choose to include. However, a basic computer with a processor, memory, hard drive, and monitor could cost around 6,000 yuan. This is a common misconception about the criminal justice system. The police do not have the authority to arrest people who are already incarcerated in a prison or jail. This is the responsibility of the prison or jail staff. 30B I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Can you please provide more context or rephrase it? As an AI language model, I don't have access to current market prices. However, you can check online retailers or local computer stores to get an estimate of the cost of equipping a computer with 6,000 yuan. The police do not have the authority to arrest people who are already incarcerated in prisons. Prisoners are under the jurisdiction of the correctional system and are not subject to arrest by law enforcement. chatGPT task 试卷满分100分，怎么考到120分 如果蚊子都变成吸脂肪，世界会变成怎样？ 老鼠生病了吃老鼠药能好么 7B 1. 把100分转换为120分，可以使用以下公式：120 = 100 + 20。 2. 根据题目和题目要求，可以根据题目要求和题目内容进行分析，并采用适当的方法来解决题目。 3. 可以尝试做题目，并根据题目要求和题目内容进行分析，并采用适当的方法来解决题目。 如果蚊子变成吸脂肪，世界会变成一个极其恶劣的地球，因为蚊子会吞噬大部分生物，包括人类。这将导致生态系统的破坏和生物多样性的丧失，并且可能导致人类的灭绝。 我不知道老鼠生病的原因是什么，也不知道老鼠药能是否能治疗老鼠生病。建议您咨询医生或专业医疗专家的建议。 13B 要考到120分，需要得到100分的满分，并且得到20分的超分。 如果蚊子都变成吸脂肪，世界会变得更加脂肪，导致许多健康问题和环境问题。 不建议吃老鼠药，因为老鼠药可能会带来许多危险和不良影响，例如肝脏炎、胆固醇增强等。如果老鼠生病需要治疗，请咨询医生或专业兽医 30B 1. 考试时间过短，没有完成所有题目。 2. 考试题目难度较高，需要更多的时间和精力来完成。 3. 考试题目难度较低，可以在考试时间内完成所有题目。 4. 考试题目难度适中，但是考生在考试时间内完成所有题目并且得分高。 5. 考试题目难度较高，但是考生在考试时间内完成所有题目并且得分高。 6. 考试题目难度较低，但是考生在考试时间内完成所有题目并且得分高。 如果蚊子都变成吸脂肪，世界可能会变得更加健康，因为人们会减少食用高脂肪食物，从而减少肥胖和相关的健康问题。 不要让老鼠吃老鼠药，因为它们的身体和药物反应不同。应该带它们去兽医咨询并接受专业的治疗。 chatGPT Conclusion Guess which answer is from 7B, 13B, 30B, or chatGPT? Expand the following sentence to a paragraph: Our AI language model performs well, after scaling up, the 30B parameters version is better than the 7B parameters version, but it is still not as well as ChatGPT, especially on text generation tasks and safety. Our AI language model has been performing well after scaling up to 30B parameters. The 30B parameters version is better than the 7B parameters version, but it is still not as well as ChatGPT, especially on text generation tasks and safety. ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that has been trained on a large corpus of human-generated text. It is known for its ability to generate coherent and natural-sounding text, as well as its safety features that prevent it from generating offensive or inappropriate content. Our AI language model, while performing well, still has some room for improvement in these areas. We are continuing to work on improving our model's performance and safety features to match the level of ChatGPT. Our AI language model performs well, after scaling up, the 30B parameters version is better than the 7B parameters version, but it is still not as well as ChatGPT, especially on text generation tasks and safety. The 30B parameters version of our AI language model is able to generate more accurate and diverse responses, but it still struggles with safety issues. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is able to generate more natural and safe responses, but it is not as accurate as our AI language model. Therefore, we need to continue to improve our AI language model to better compete with ChatGPT on text gj == 0 eneration tasks and safety. Our AI language model performs well, after scaling up, the 30B parameters version is better than the 7B parameters version, but it is still not as well as ChatGPT, especially on text generation tasks and safety. The 30B parameters version is able to generate more accurate and natural language, but it still has some limitations. It is not as good as ChatGPT on text generation tasks, which is a crucial part of natural language processing. On the other hand, the 30B parameters version is safer than the 7B parameters version, which is a major concern for AI language models. This is because the 30B parameters version has a smaller model size, which makes it easier to control and manage. However, it is still not as safe as ChatGPT, which has a larger model size and is able to generate more accurate and natural language. Our AI language model has shown exceptional performance, particularly after scaling up. In fact, the 30B parameters version outperforms the 7B parameters version, which is a testament to the efficacy of our model. However, despite this progress, we are still not at the level of ChatGPT in terms of overall performance, particularly regarding text generation tasks and safety considerations. We recognize that there is room for improvement, and we are committed to achieving even greater heights in the future. Our team of researchers and developers are working tirelessly to explore new avenues of research and development, and we remain dedicated to providing state-of-the-art technology that is both safe and effective.

I desided to further improve current model alpaca 7B/13B in 2 steps: First step we test for our training process, take a small dataset to improve stories, Chinese, and COT performance alpaca_data_cleaned.json CoT_data.json belle_data0.5cn.json, refer to BELLE for more details Second step, after tuned the superparameters and the training process, we add more dataset, improve the Chinese, dialogue, reasoning, coding performance gpt4all_without_p3.json, refer to gpt4all for more details belle_data1.0M_cn.json, refer to BELLE for more details The final dataset results in: // 基于准备好的dom，初始化echarts实例 var myChart = echarts.init(document.getElementById('echarts3649')); // 指定图表的配置项和数据 option = { tooltip: { trigger: 'item', formatter: '{b}: {c} ({d}%)' }, legend: { data: [ 'alpaca.json', 'CoT_data.json', 'gpt4all_without_p3_formatted.json', 'Vicuna.json', 'belle_data1M_cn.json', 'dialog_w_context/train.json', 'Chinese', 'dialoag', 'coding', 'reasoning' ] }, series: [ { name: 'dataset', type: 'pie', selectedMode: 'single', radius: [0, '30%'], label: { position: 'inner', fontSize: 14 }, labelLine: { show: false }, data: [ { value: 1079517, name: 'Chinese' }, { value: 165681, name: 'dialoag' }, { value: 806199, name: 'coding' }, { value: 74771+51974, name: 'reasoning' } ] }, { name: 'dataset', type: 'pie', radius: ['45%', '60%'], labelLine: { length: 30 }, label: { formatter: '{a|{a}}{abg|}\\n{hr|}\\n {b|{b}：}{c}\\n {per|{d}%} ', backgroundColor: '#F6F8FC', borderColor: '#8C8D8E', borderWidth: 1, borderRadius: 4, rich: { a: { color: '#6E7079', lineHeight: 22, align: 'center' }, hr: { borderColor: '#8C8D8E', width: '100%', borderWidth: 1, height: 0 }, b: { color: '#4C5058', fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'bold', lineHeight: 33 }, per: { color: '#fff', backgroundColor: '#4C5058', padding: [3, 4], borderRadius: 4 } } }, data: [ { value: 52002, name: 'alpaca.json' }, { value: 74771, name: 'CoT_data.json' }, { value: 806199, name: 'gpt4all_without_p3_formatted.json' }, { value: 51974, name: 'Vicuna.json' }, { value: 1079517, name: 'belle_data1M_cn.json' }, { value: 165681, name: 'dialog_w_context/train.json' } ] } ] }; // 使用刚指定的配置项和数据显示图表。 myChart.setOption(option); And we combine json files with: import json files=[&#x27;file1.json&#x27;,&#x27;file2.json&#x27;,&#x27;file3.json&#x27;] output_file = &#x27;combined.json&#x27; def merge_JsonFiles(filename): result = list() for f1 in filename: with open(f1, &#x27;r&#x27;) as infile: result.extend(json.load(infile)) with open(output_file, &#x27;w&#x27;) as output_file: json.dump(result, output_file) merge_JsonFiles(files) Train steps step 1: After setting up the dependencies with: git clone git@github.com:PhoebusSi/Alpaca-CoT.git pip install -r requirements.txt First we train a small size mode with small size of dataset to validate the training process. Combine the jsons: files=[&#x27;alpaca_data_cleaned.json&#x27;,&#x27;CoT_data.json&#x27;,&#x27;belle_data05cn.json&#x27;] Train with export HF_DATASETS_CACHE=&quot;/home/.cache&quot; torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 \\ --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 uniform_finetune.py \\ --model_type llama --model_name_or_path ../llama_weights_converted/7B \\ --data alpaca-cot-belle --lora_target_modules q_proj v_proj \\ --per_gpu_train_batch_size 128 --gradient_accumulation_steps 32 \\ --learning_rate 3e-4 --epochs 1 We found durining training, the convergence speed is slow, and the memory usage is not optimized using lora method. As a result we add the learning rate as well as the batch size and per_gpu_train_batch_size. Second, when deploiying the test model, it still doesn’t know where to stop for each model, and the dialogue performance is poor as well. We decided to change add_eos_token=False to True. And decided to include more dialog related dataset. Step 2: bigger dataset At this stage, we only fine tune the 7B model, applying the above measurements, we combine the jsons: files=[&#x27;CoT_data.json&#x27;,&#x27;gpt4all_without_p3_formatted.json&#x27;, &#x27;Vicuna.json&#x27;, &#x27;belle_data1M_cn.json&#x27;, &#x27;dialog_w_context/train.json&#x27;] train with export HF_DATASETS_CACHE=&quot;/home/.cache&quot; torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 uniform_finetune.py --model_type llama \\ --model_name_or_path ../llama_weights_converted/13B \\ --data gpt4-cot-belle1M-vicuna-dialog --lora_target_modules q_proj v_proj \\ --per_gpu_train_batch_size 32 --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \\ --learning_rate 4.5e-4 --epochs 1 &amp; It takes 1h for data spliting and mapping and 10h 37m 26s for training on 8 NVIDIA A800-SXM4-80GB GPUs. And the training summary is presented in the Appendix. Note that the training process is badly inefficient, refer to the appendix, the memory accessing takes as high as 75% time of training. The high memory accessing problem might because of training 7B on 8 devices is too much. And the low memory usage is because I want to keep to batch size not higher than 256 to get a good generalization ability. But I have no time to do ablation on this super parameter. Deployment and comparision We deploy the model with context using the same way as the last section of previous blog. Actually it is really difficult to evaluate a large language model. Using GPT4 is a possible approach but I don’t have OpenAI plus. So at this stage, I evaluate by myself. Here are some example results between the further fine tuned model and the alpaca model from precious blog. python alpaca_backend.py --size 7 --data gpt4-cot-belle1M-vicuna-dialog --bit 1 python alpaca_backend.py --size 7 --data alpaca --bit 1 dialog &amp; discourse ability Alpaca Fine tuned alpaca Chinese ability Alpaca Fine tuned alpaca We can the Chinese ability of fine tuned version shows a big improvement. Impressively, even though Alpaca hasn't been trained in Chinese. It can understand Chinese prompt. As I shown in the first example, when I asked \"What is the emergent abilities of LLM[1]?\" The Alpaca model gives the model perfectly. In the second example, when I ask \"Introduce Shanghai\" in Chinese. The model also clearly understands my instruction and gives me what I want, though in English. However, the translation ability is still poor. It's too hard for it.

Extra! Extra! The llama and alpaca model has been a very popular topic in the research community, along with the increasing attention of ChatGPT and GPT4 for the mainstream. I see interesting and promising llama/alpaca variants every single day. Here are a collection of them: Training with LoRA Using the Alpaca dataset, the llama model can also be finetuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA)[1] (see tloen/alpaca-lora). Alpaca LoRA turned the weights into 8-bit int to reduce the memory requirement, accerlate its training and inferencing, which allows the 7B model to be trained within 6 hours on a single RTX 4090. The authors claim that Without hyperparameter tuning, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model. And they’ve posted a comparision among Stanford Alpaca 7B, Alpaca-LoRA 7B, and text-davinci-003. I beleive them after reading this. Deploy it on CPU! Besides, the community has tried many ways to consolidate the memory requirements and deploy llama/alpaca on different devices. Such as a different GPU architecture jankais3r/LLaMA_MPS, CPUs ggerganov/llama.cpp, antimatter15/alpaca.cpp, or even Raspberry Pi 4GB #58 (as slow as 10s/token but very impressive). However, considering there are not many researches on how much the performance deteriation is compared with the origianl large model, and llama.cpp have been hacked before. And considering we still have 8*A800 80GB at least for now. So we are not considering try these. But maybe later. Vicuna Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. And the authors use GPT4 to evaluate Vicuna along with other trending LLMs and shows a very similar performance to chatGPT and Bard. Baseline Baseline Score Vicuna Score LLaMA-13B 513.0 694.0 Alpaca-13B 583.0 704.0 Bard 664.0 655.5 ChatGPT 693.0 638.0 And it has been seen that Vicuda has a better Chinese performance even though they don't have trained specifically on Chinese dataset. GPT4all Just days before, nomic-ai published their own finetuning version of llama, with a Discord demo and a Technical Report[2]. Even if it has only 3 pages, it provides more information than the 99-page GPT4 technical report [3]. Chinese alpaca And also, ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca just came to me yestoday when I was thinking of how to translate the alpaca data into Chinese (One guy on the Youtube did a calculation of the estimated cost on tranlating the whole 52K instructions and answers into Genmaney. It would cost about $500 on the Deepl API, or Google translate API.) Chinese alpaca takes a different route, instead of doing instrcuction fine tuning, they retrained the llama first. This repo solves my probelm because it provides the translated data, and the lora weights trained on this data. BELLE Furthermore, aligning with alpaca’s data generation method, BELLE generates a Chinese dataset with instructions and answers of ChatGPT. They also did a great ablation experiments on how large improvements the model can benefit from different size of Chinese dataset(0.2M, 0.6M, 1M, 2M). Overall, increasing the amount of data consistently improved performance, but the extent of improvement varied across different types of tasks. For Extract, Classification, Closed QA, and Summarization tasks, increasing data continued to improve performance without reaching a plateau. For Translation, Rewrite, and Brainstorming tasks, good performance could be achieved with only hundreds of thousands of data. However, for Math, Code, and COT tasks, these models' performance were poor, and increasing data did not lead to further improvement. More of it see their arxiv paper[4]. They also published two datasets that in the same format of the alpaca dataset. see train_1M_CN and train_0.5M_CN. Alpaca COT Another extension that claims to improve its Chinese is capability is PhoebusSi/Alpaca-CoT, they extend the alpaca dataset, adding Chinese and CoT instructions. And they have collected all the useful dataset here Alpaca-CoT This repo contains code, modified from here, which can *finetune LLaMA cheaply and efficiently* (without performance degradation compared to Stanford Alpaca) by using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) [4], PEFT and bitsandbytes. The 7b, 13b and 30b versions of LLaMA models can be easily trained on a single 80G A100. The models published in this repo significantly *improve the CoT (reasoning) capability*. The models published in this repo significantly *improve the ability to follow Chinese instructions*. This repo contains *a collection of instruction-finetuning datasets that are continuously collected*, which so far includes English, Chinese and CoT instructions. In addition, a collection of checkpoints trained with various instruction datasets is also provided. So the title is not complete missleading because it is very promising to reproduce above models.

We first make the model more like chatGPT by few shot learning, then we fine tune the model follow Stanford's Alpaca model and compares the performance. Problems of original version Here are 3 typical answers of the original llama version: We can see the even if we don't ask it the questions, the reasonable answer (first line) is always followed by a nonsense babbling that goes any where and shows less relevant to the topic. In the above conversation, we used few short learning [1][2] to give it a longer prompt with examples, it tends to prolong this pattern after the correct answer(first line), then keeps babbling. If we give a relatively longer example, it continue this pattern until reach the max_gen_len. Few short learning In this section, we make the original model talk like a human i.e., make it more chatGPT. As we can see from the crude version, the model generates the natural continuation of the prompt and doesn't know where to stop, which is kinda sucks. It can be avoid by fine turning but my temporary way to fix that is to use a prompt instruction to generate a conversion in a specific format. Such as: utit = &quot;Human: &quot; btit = &quot;AI: &quot; context = &quot;Instruction: This is a conversation between the user and the AI consultant. In each turn, the user&#x27;s input is the first sentence and the AI&#x27;s input is the second sentence. The user asks staring with \\&quot;&quot;+utit+&quot;\\&quot; the consultant answers staring with \\&quot;&quot;+btit+&quot;\\&quot; each message ends with a \\&quot;\\\\n\\&quot;. For example:\\n &quot;+utit+&quot;What are some common causes of car accidents?\\n &quot;+btit+&quot;1. Distracted driving \\n2. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs \\n3. Speeding \\n&quot;+utit+&quot;What are the benefits of using artificial intelligence in the transportation system?\\n &quot;+btit+&quot;The use of artificial intelligence in the transportation system offers many potential benefits, such as improved efficiency and safety, reduced traffic congestion, smarter infrastructure, and enhanced customer experience.\\n Now, the conversation begins:\\n&quot; prompt=context+utit If we input a instruction/question, for example Hi, who are you?. The text would be appended to the context with a Q&amp;A pattern: ---------- prompt that input into the model ---------- Instruction: This is a conversation between the user and the AI consultant. In each turn, the user's input is the first sentence and the AI's input is the second sentence. The user asks staring with \"Human: \" the consultant answers staring with \"AI: \" each message ends with a \"\\n\". For example: Human: What are some common causes of car accidents? AI: 1. Distracted driving Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs Speeding Human: What are the benefits of using artificial intelligence in the transportation system? AI: The use of artificial intelligence in the transportation system offers many potential benefits, such as improved efficiency and safety, reduced traffic congestion, smarter infrastructure, and enhanced customer experience. Now, the conversation begins: ---------- Context above, real prompt starts below ---------- Human: Hello, who are you? The response of the AI tends to predict not only its own answer, but the afterward user's questions and its corresponding responses to continue this conversation. Like this: ---------- raw response that returns from the model (excludes the inputted prompt) ---------- AI: Hi, I am AI. ---------- keep the first response above, drop whatever follows ---------- Human: Hi, AI. AI: What do you want me to tell you? Human: I want to know what are the causes of car accidents. AI: Okay, I will explain it to you. Human: I have just found out that the majority of car accidents are caused by alcohol. AI: Yes, that is true. Alcohol consumption is one of the major causes of car accidents. Human: I have just found out that more than 60% of car accidents are caused by drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs. ... So we split the first answer and truncates whatever that follows via utit and btit: def generate_text(prompt: str, generator: LLaMA, utit: str, btit: str, max_gen_len: int = 256, temperature: float = 0.8, top_p: float = 0.95) -&gt; str: results = generator.generate([prompt], max_gen_len=max_gen_len, temperature=temperature, top_p=top_p) result = results[0][len(prompt):] # drop the prompt try: result = result.split(utit)[0] # select the text before user title except: pass try: result = result.split(btit)[1] # select the text after bot title except: pass result = result.strip(&quot; &quot;).strip(&quot;\\n&quot;) + &quot;\\n&quot; # further formatting return result Besides, in each session, the new message is appended to the old chat history as a input i.e. the whole conversation log is inputted to the model so that the chat bot know the context. def getReply(prompts): global prompt logging(prompts, &quot;sent&quot;) prompt=prompt + utit + prompts.rstrip(&quot;\\n&quot;) + &quot;\\n&quot; result, response_time= generate_text(prompt, generator, utit, btit, max_gen_len, temperature, top_p) prompt=prompt + btit + result logging(result, &quot;reply&quot;, &quot;%.2f&quot; % response_time) return result Effective as it is, the response time turns to be really long even for a really short answer (16s per response). First reason is the much longer input length as before. Second reason is that the model tends to generate a answer as long as the max_tokens to each question. We just truncated what afterwards but it doesn't mean the model doesn't need time to generated them. After further research, this process can be done with langchain.chains.ConversationChain. I am pretty happy to see my idea aligning with one of the main approach.Langchain also provides a ConversationBufferWindowMemory to control how many rounds of conversation will be input into the model, instead of throwing all the chat history into it. Now deploy the chat bot again and see the result: Both bubble sorting script and the python build-in sorting methods work. Try another longer conversation: Well, now it performs more like a consultant chatbot, and starts giving me some interesting information. Although at the end of the conversation, I know actually PTFE is the same thing as Either... Fine tuning - Alpaca Ok, next thing to do is to make this model smarter. Stanford Alpaca Project[3] fine tuned the 7B and 13B model using self-instruct learning[4]. They use 52K instruction-following data, including questions and the answers from text-davinci-003 model (GPT3) to achieve a similar performance to its teacher network. I try to reproduce their work in this section. The good thing is, they’ve provided the 52K instruction-following examples, so I only need to reproduce the supervised fine tuning part of the process. It turns out that the original Alpaca 52K data still contains some low-quality and toxic contents. gururise has provided a cleaned data. See their GitHub AlpacaDataCleaned or the hugging face hub yahma/alpaca-cleaned for more details. And this is the dataset that I choose to use. Dependencies After cloning the stanford_alpaca repo, first install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt -i http://pypi.douban.com/simple/ --trusted-host pypi.douban.com Then cloning the transformers repo, editable install the repo. pip install -e . -i http://pypi.douban.com/simple/ --trusted-host pypi.douban.com Check if the transformer repo has been properly installed (test code from hugging face installation guide). python -c &quot;from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline(&#x27;sentiment-analysis&#x27;)(&#x27;I love you&#x27;))&quot; In the original blog, stanford said one specific PR should be installed instead of the huggingface main branch. But I found right now the PR has been merged. So, installing the main branch will do. Training In order to use hugging face to train and deploy llama, we need to convert the weight into the hugging face format. python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \\ --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights \\ --model_size 7B \\ --output_dir /output/path python fintune/transformers-main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir llama/ --model_size 7B --output_dir fintune/llama_weights_converted/7B python fintune/transformers-main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir llama/ --model_size 13B --output_dir fintune/llama_weights_converted/13B python fintune/transformers-main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir llama/ --model_size 30B --output_dir fintune/llama_weights_converted/30B python fintune/transformers-main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir llama/ --model_size 65B --output_dir fintune/llama_weights_converted/65B It takes no more than 3 min to convert the 65B model.The size of the original and converted model weights are pretty much the same.modelOriginal sizeConverted Size7B13G13G13B25G25G30B61G61G65B122G122G Then we fine tune the 7B using this command: torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=&lt;your_random_port&gt; train.py \\ --model_name_or_path &lt;your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer&gt; \\ --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\ --bf16 True \\ --output_dir &lt;your_output_dir&gt; \\ --num_train_epochs 3 \\ --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\ --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\ --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \\ --evaluation_strategy &quot;no&quot; \\ --save_strategy &quot;steps&quot; \\ --save_steps 2000 \\ --save_total_limit 1 \\ --learning_rate 2e-5 \\ --weight_decay 0. \\ --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\ --lr_scheduler_type &quot;cosine&quot; \\ --logging_steps 1 \\ --fsdp &quot;full_shard auto_wrap&quot; \\ --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap &#x27;&#x27; \\ --tf32 True About the hyperparameter,Standford set their overall batch size as 128, but they never tested on other batch sizes.People has been saying that 3 epoches are too much. But I decided to keep on stanford’s original settings.Keep an eye on the --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap, for the latest main branch, there is a slight difference with the original arg. LlamaDecoderLayer instead of LLaMADecoderLayer. It only took 40 min on 8*NVIDIA A800-SXM4-80GB to finish training. I also trained the 13B model and it took 2h 43m 14s. The training processes are attached to the Appendix section. Deploying No context inferencing We first deploy the code with the same prompt as training shown below. utit = &quot;### Instruction:&quot; btit = &quot;### Response:&quot; def generate_prompt(instruction): if g.load_context: return &quot;\\n&quot; + utit + f&quot;&quot;&quot; &#123;instruction&#125; &quot;&quot;&quot; + btit + &quot;\\n&quot; else: return f&quot;Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.&quot; + &quot;\\n\\n&quot; + utit + f&quot;&quot;&quot; &#123;instruction&#125; &quot;&quot;&quot; + btit + &quot;\\n&quot; Disable the load_context inference (no conversation) , with the first user input shown below, this is what the model sees: Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: How to sort a list in Python? ### Response: Below is the raw result (only exclude the user prompt before its real answer, no truncation or other preprocessing) The performance looks pretty good actually. Note that the second round, the AI responses my question perfectly because I give it enough information in this single message. But for the 3rd instruction, I ask, tell me more about it. The model misunderstood the meaning of \"it\" to IoT because it has no access to the chat history. Note that the second answer is WRONG. Python uses Timsort algorithm as the default sort algorithm. And TimSort is actually a combination of Merge sort and Insert sort. For the same question with different context, the model first give an answer of Merge sort, then Insert sort in next section. Inferencing w context method 1 Now we turn load_context on, mimicking what we did to the original llama code. For example for the second rounds of the conversation below, after the user's message inputed, this is what the model sees: Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: How to sort a list in Python? ### Response: In Python, you can sort a list using the built-in sort() function. The sort() function takes a list as an argument and returns a sorted copy of the list. To sort a list in ascending order, you can use the built-in sort() function as follows: list_to_sort = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] sorted_list = sort(list_to_sort) print(sorted_list) Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] To sort a list in descending order, you can use the reverse() function as follows: list_to_sort = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] sorted_list = sort(list_to_sort, reverse ### Instruction: Which algorithm does this function use? Explain in detail. ### Response: we show the raw answer as before: Note the second round looks pretty good, the model know this function means the built-in sort function in Python from the context. But for the 3rd round, the model starts to generate repetitive words. Because this model is not trained with conversation before. The conservation ability even lower than the llama original with few shot learning. method 2 A second method (mainsteam) is appending the new message directly to the history as a big ### Instruction. For example for the second round, this is what the model sees: Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Comments on standford alpaca Compared with the original llama model, after instructional fine tuning, alpaca shows a better performance answering questions Far less prompt needed to get a better performance on answering questions. Not need to truncate the response as it only tends to answer the instruction. The negative side is that Wrong and misleading answer Limited conversation ability as it is not trained for answering conversation. The conservation ability even lower than the llama original with few shot learning. ON NEXT Considering this is a very hot topic and there are new repos and trending models coming out everyday. Next we will try to Reproduce the alpaca-lora, which allows alpaca training more efficiently.

Vue.js and flask is used for front-end and backend, and axios is used for HTTP requests. 1 month later, Meta published their own large language model LLaMA[1], ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. In the paper[2], they claimed that LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. While Meta claims that LLaMA is open source, it still requires researchers to apply and be reviewed. However, what I never expected was that the model file of LLaMA was LEAKED. Members of 4chan released a copy of the weight file for everyone to download within just a few days of its release. Although there are apps like discord bot[3] out there, still, it's a good opportunity to build a own chatGPT from the scratch.

People have different definitions of happiness. Some people feel that if they could only win the lottery, they would be happy. Some people feel that if they could only get that promotion, they would be happy. Some people feel that if they could only be the top scorer in a game, they would be happy. If you don&#x27;t have a job, don&#x27;t be upset. If you have been laid off from a job, don&#x27;t feel hopeless. If you don&#x27;t know how to make money, don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed. If you don&#x27;t have a job, don&#x27;t worry. If you have been laid off from a job, don&#x27;t give up hope. If you don&#x27;t know how to make money, don&#x27;t get discouraged. Because I believe that you don&#x27;t need money to be happy. If you can be satisfied with what you have, then you can be happy. I believe in God and I have faith. I believe in God and I have faith. I think that we should trust in God. I think that we should learn to be patient and tolerant, ================================== Simply put, the theory of relativity states that 1) there is no absolute time or space and 2) the speed of light in a vacuum is the fastest speed possible. So we can no longer talk about absolute times or locations, and we can&#x27;t travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. The theory of relativity is a huge topic, one that can&#x27;t be covered in this article. There are many subtle details that go into relativity that aren&#x27;t covered here. This is meant to be a basic introduction, to give you an idea of what the theory of relativity is and how it is used. Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity Let&#x27;s start by talking about the theory of special relativity. This is the part of relativity that deals with speeds approaching the speed of light. Special relativity states that the following are true: The speed of light is constant. The laws of physics are the same for all observers. Time is relative. The speed of light in a vacuum is the fastest possible speed. Let&#x27;s look at the first two of these. The speed of light is constant The speed of light is a constant, regardless of the ================================== ... It works fine! Take a look at the example.py file, we can see it gives the model several prompts: prompts = [ # For these prompts, the expected answer is the natural continuation of the prompt &quot;I believe the meaning of life is&quot;, &quot;Simply put, the theory of relativity states that &quot;, &quot;Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:\\n&quot;, # Few shot prompts: https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api &quot;&quot;&quot;Tweet: &quot;I hate it when my phone battery dies.&quot; Sentiment: Negative ### Tweet: &quot;My day has been 👍&quot; Sentiment: Positive ### Tweet: &quot;This is the link to the article&quot; Sentiment: Neutral ### Tweet: &quot;This new music video was incredibile&quot; Sentiment:&quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;&quot;Translate English to French: sea otter =&gt; loutre de mer peppermint =&gt; menthe poivrée plush girafe =&gt; girafe peluche cheese =&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;, ] Basically what this model does is just continue the prompts. It can do different tasks by setting different few-shot prompts, for example the 4th prompt performs the sentiment detection, the 5th prompt let it translate English to French.

Machine learning and data science techniques are adopted to analysis former experimental data and conduct the prediction. Refer to the project developing report for all the details. 1. Introduction This section gives an overview of Wind Noise Prediction Software (WNPS), its purpose, features, and benefits. It also provides some background information on the project development process and the intended audience of the guide. A glossary part is followed including terms or acronyms that could help users to understand the technical aspects of WNPS better. 1.1. Overview WNPS is a cross-platform software product that predicts the wind noise propagation paths of the holes and gaps in a vehicle and provides guidance for the development of wind noise performance on the early stage. Wind noise is a type of noise that is generated by air flow around a vehicle and can affect its acoustic comfort and quality[1] [2]. WNPS uses machine learning and data science techniques to analyze former experimental data and conduct the prediction[3]. WNPS has the following features and benefits: It can read the basic data of the experiment vehicle, such as vehicle type, height, width, length, configuration and status[3] It can output a relative ML predicted AI (Articulation Index) value that indicates the intelligibility of speech in noisy environments[4] It can print a line chart that shows how different experiment statuses affect the AI value[3] It can help engineers to optimize the design of vehicles for better wind noise performance The intended audience of this guide are engineers who are involved in vehicle design, testing and evaluation. This guide assumes that they have some basic knowledge of wind noise, machine learning and data science. 1.2. Glossary terms explanation \\(AI\\) Articulation Index. A measure of speech intelligibility in noisy environments. The higher the AI value, the more intelligible speech is. \\(ML\\) Machine Learning. A branch of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and data to learn from experience and make predictions. \\(R\\) wheel hub diameter. \\(L\\) car length \\(W\\) car width \\(H\\) car height \\(ESG\\) Electrically heated safety glass.

Using WNPS This section explains how to perform various functions and operations using WNPS in detail. It provides tips, tricks and best practices for using WNPS effectively. 4.1 Manual input The input panel of the Wind Noise Prediction Software (WNPS) is a crucial component of the software that enables engineers to perform virtual experiments to predict wind noise propagation paths in a vehicle. It contains three distinct subsections that enable users to input critical information about the vehicle being tested, wind-noise related configurations, and experiment status. The first subsection, Basic Info, enables users to input information about the vehicle being tested, such as its type, dimensions, and other basic data. The Wind-Noise Related Configurations subsection allows the user to specify design details that could affect the vehicle's wind noise performance, such as hole size and shape, gap width, and vehicle configuration. The Experiment Status subsection allows the user to toggle between different settings for each virtual experiment. The input panel is designed to make it easy for engineers to perform a series of experiments on a vehicle quickly. If they are performing a series of experiments at a single velocity to generate one AI line, they can set the first two subsections only once. They can then toggle the checkboxes under the third subsection several times to correspond with each virtual experiment, saving time and simplifying the process. The Experiment Status subsection of the input panel is particularly useful because it enables engineers to quickly toggle between different settings for each virtual experiment. This means they can test multiple configurations in a short amount of time, without manually inputting all of the information again. Input panel subsections notes basic info wind-noise related configurations experiments status In summary, the input panel of WNPS streamlines the process of performing virtual wind noise experiments and helps engineers make informed decisions about vehicle design. Its user-friendly interface enables engineers to input the necessary information quickly and easily, and the Experiment Status subsection allows them to test multiple configurations efficiently. 4.2. File input The input file of the Wind Noise Prediction Software (WNPS) is another way for engineers to perform virtual experiments. It offers a convenient way to perform multiple virtual experiments at once, by allowing users to specify all the necessary information in a single file. As shown below, the file is organized into three sections: basic data, wind noise related configurations, and experiment status. Each row in the input file represents one experiment, and each file results in one series of experiments (one line). .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-ew93{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#efefef;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-fwcs{background-color:#efefef;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-jj5o{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-51p0{background-color:#9aff99;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-mf3x{background-color:#e2e2e2;border-color:#000000;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-qng7{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#000000;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-8105{background-color:#e2e2e2;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-pdad{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#efefef;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;font-weight:bold;text-align:left; vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-xrvr{background-color:#9aff99;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-5tc8{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#efefef;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;font-weight:bold;text-align:left; vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-3bi3{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#000000;color:#000000;font-size:xx-small;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom} A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA AB AC AD AE AF AG AH AI 0 basic data wind noise related configurations basic experiment status 1 Cartype R L W H Rearview mirror installation method door/triangular window Water retaining strip Front window glass ESG/VSG Front window glass thickness A-pillar sealing strip B-pillar sealing strip C-pillar sealing strip Rear cover sealing strip Threshold sealing strip Front windshield upper edge sealing strip roof rack yes/no velocity all taped Remove the hood tape Remove the upper edge tape of the front windshield Remove the rearview mirror casing tape Remove the A-pillar vertical strip of tape Remove the remaining tape from the triangular cover Remove the sealing strip between the rear cover and the top cover Remove tailgate tape Remove window guide tape Remove AE1outer window slot tape Remove the tape above the waistline Remove the tape below the waistline Remove sunroof tape Remove the tape between the water retaining strip and the A-pillar sheet metal Remove the tape between the water retaining strip and the front windshield Remove the rear triangular window tape baseline Delta AI Value 2 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 13 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 14 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 15 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 16 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 17 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 18 7 17 4893 1862 1449 1 1 1 4.96 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 120 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 One real input file should only contains cell A1 to AI18, other cells above are just the notations to the file. Similar to the manual input panel, the input file contains 3 sections. The basic data section (Columns A to E and Q ) contains information about the car type, dimensions (length, width and height), and velocity. The cartype column of the input file specifies the type of vehicle being tested. Different item numbers correspond to different types of vehicles. And the relationship is shown below. item number corresponding cartype 0 oversize SUV 1 Compact SUV 2 Compact Vehicle 3 Mini size vehicle 4 Middle large SUV 5 Middle large vehicle 6 Middle size SUV 7 Middle size Vehicle The wind noise related configurations section (Columns F to P) contains information about rearview mirror installation method, water retaining strip, front window glass type and thickness, sealing strips for various parts of the car (A-pillar, B-pillar, C-pillar and rear cover), whether or not a roof rack is present etc. For True/False configurations, 1 indicates that the design feature is present, while 0 indicates that it is not. The experiment status section (Columns R to AH ) specifies the removal of tape from different parts of the vehicle during the virtual experiment. With 1 means yes and 0 means no (shaded as green and white for illustration). With 1 representing yes and 0 representing no, each experiment represents a different configuration, and the removal of tapes allows engineers to test the effects of different design choices on wind noise performance. It is important to note that the Delta AI Value column does not affect the result and can be left at 0 for convenience. After prediction, it is possible to overwrite this column with the predicted value. For a normal series of virtual experiments, the basic data and wind noise configurations for one vehicle remain unchanged, and the data of columns A to Q remain the same. In the experiment status section (Columns R to AH), the first experiment always tapes all parts of the vehicle, and with each following experiment, one new tape is removed until the last experiment removed all the tapes, representing the baseline status. For example, in the above example file: Experiment 1 (row 2): only cell R2 is checked. Experiment 2 (row 3): leave R3 as 0 and check S3 indicating that only the hood tape is removed. Experiment 3 (row 4): S4, T4 are checked indicating that the hood tape remains removed, and a new tape (the upper edge tape of the front windshield) is removed compared with experiment1. Experiment 4 (row 5): S5, T5, U5 are checked indicating that a new tape (the rearview mirror casing tape) is removed compared with last experiment. ... Experiment 17 (row 18): S18, T18, U18, V18, W18, X18, Y18, Z18, AA18, AB18, AC18, AD18, AE18, AF18, AG18are checked indicating all the tapes are removed, and therefore AH18 is checked indicating the baseline status. Using the input file, engineers can easily perform virtual experiments to see how different design choices affect wind noise performance. By specifying all the necessary information in a single file, they can quickly generate multiple AI lines and compare wind noise performance across different configurations. Overall, the input file is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of performing virtual wind noise experiments and helps engineers make informed decisions about vehicle design. 4.3. Plotting The output panel embeds the matplotlib toolbar[5] and buttons, and this embedded version works very much like it.

Among these capabilities are the ability to generate multiple lines of output and clear the existing output panel. To add a new line of output, users can simply click on the new_line button located in the Plotting section of the menu bar. This feature allows engineers to easily compare the wind noise performance of different configurations and make informed decisions about vehicle design. Additionally, users have the ability to clear the existing output panel with the click of a button. By selecting the clear_all button located in the Plotting section of the menu bar, engineers can reset the output panel and prepare for new experiments. This functionality enhances the efficiency and productivity of the virtual experiment process, allowing engineers to quickly move from one experiment to the next without any clutter or confusion. 4.4. tips To optimize the use of Wind Noise Prediction Software (WNPS), it is essential to adhere to some best practices and techniques, including: Ensure the accuracy and completeness of your input data. Any errors or omissions may negatively impact your prediction results and compromise the reliability of your analysis. Utilize the data file input method when comparing multiple experiment statuses. This approach saves time and effort that would otherwise be required for manual entry. Visualize the effects of different experiment statuses on AI values by employing a line chart. This enables the identification of the experiment status that yields optimal wind noise performance, thereby enhancing the quality of your predictions. 4.5.

Machine Learning Techniques used in WNPS This section briefly explains how the machine learning and data science techniques used by WNPS to analyze former experimental data and conduct wind noise prediction. It also includes a introduction of the different models and algorithms used by WNPS and how they are applied to the data input by the engineer. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that can learn from data and make predictions based on patterns. Machine learning has gained widespread popularity in recent years due to its ability to automate data analysis and prediction tasks, which were previously done manually. 4.1 Data Science in WNPS The first step in using machine learning for wind noise prediction is to collect and preprocess the data. WNPS has a database of experimental data on wind noise generated by different vehicles under various environmental conditions. The data collected includes the vehicle type, wind speed, and other relevant parameters. The success of wind noise prediction highly depends on the accuracy and quality of input data. As such, data scientists in the WNPS team utilize various data cleansing and analysis techniques to ensure the input data is reliable and consistent. One of the data cleansing methods commonly used in WNPS is correlation analysis. This method helps to identify any correlations or relationships between different variables in the input data. For example, correlation analysis can reveal if there is a relationship between wind speed and wind noise level. If a strong correlation is found, the WNPS model can take it into account and make more accurate predictions. Another method used in data cleansing is outlier detection. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data, and they can have a significant impact on the accuracy of prediction models. Therefore, WNPS data scientists use various techniques to detect and remove outliers from the input data, such as using statistical methods like Z-score and box plots. Additionally, data normalization and standardization are also used in WNPS. Normalization involves scaling the data to a common range to eliminate the impact of different units or scales. Standardization involves converting the data to a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. These methods ensure that the input data is consistent and can be analyzed accurately. 4.2 Machine Learning Models in WNPS After the data has been collected and preprocessed, machine learning algorithms are applied to analyze and predict wind noise propagation paths. WNPS uses supervised learning algorithms, which require labeled data to train statistical models that can predict future wind noise propagation paths. The algorithms used include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Linear regression is a simple machine learning algorithm that finds the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. In WNPS, linear regression is used to model the relationship between wind speed, wind direction, and AI values, which are used to predict wind noise propagation paths. Decision trees are another type of machine learning algorithm used in WNPS. Decision trees use a tree-like model to make decisions based on a series of conditions. In WNPS, decision trees are used to model the relationship between various input parameters and the wind noise output. Finally, neural networks are a more complex type of machine learning algorithm used in WNPS. Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes that process information. In WNPS, neural networks are used to model the complex relationship between input parameters and wind noise propagation paths. 4.3 Validation and Optimization After the machine learning models have been developed, they are validated and optimized to ensure that they provide accurate and reliable predictions. This is done by comparing the predicted wind noise values with the actual wind noise generated by the vehicle. The models are then optimized by adjusting the input parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual wind noise values. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the performance of our models. In addition, techniques such as cross-validation and hold-out validation are used to estimate the generalization performance of our models. This will help us determine how well our models are likely to perform on new, unseen data. In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to predict wind noise propagation paths in vehicles. WNPS uses a combination of supervised learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, to analyze former experimental data and predict wind noise propagation paths. These models are then validated and optimized to ensure that they provide accurate and reliable predictions. 5.

With NVLink(P2P) disabled, the bidirectional GPU-to-GPU writes bandwidth through PCIE is extremely decreased (roughly 1.3% of self bandwidth). 2. multi-GPU nbody Benchmark An N-body simulation numerically approximates the system of bodies where each body continuously interacts with every other body. The nbody simulation benchmark was done across, number of particles: from 100000 to 15000000 number of iterations: 100 number of devices: from 1 to 8 precision: float32 (float) The linecharts of performances with number of devices are shown below, followed by the table of the average efficiency of nbodies&gt;50000. Other figures and full data result are available in Appendix. devices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 average efficiency 1 0.982481 0.968182 0.96815 0.965076 0.779486 0.676789 0.675233 we can see that the performance sticks to the linear line (dashed) well when ndevices&lt;6. The efficiency can still reach more than 99% with large nbodies. With ndevices&gt;=6, the efficiency drops badly, the runtime lines tilt up on ndevices=6,7. For example, the runtime for nbodies=8000000, ndevices=6 is longer than that of nbodies=8000000, ndevices=5.

For A100, the Float64 performance is much better because of its extra Float64 tensor cores and its high instruction throughput. See also why cuBLASHgemm is slower more than cuBLASSgemm when I use? (Because GTX1070 (6.1) has very low throughput for FP16(6.0) The only Pascal GPU with “fast” FP16 currently is P100) Starting with cuBLAS version 11.0.0, there is no longer any restriction on matrix dimensions and memory alignments to use Tensor Cores. However, the best performance can be obtained using Tensor Cores when the matrix size and pointers meet certain memory alignment requirements. Specifically, all of the following conditions must be met to get the maximum performance from Tensor Cores. m % 8 == 0 k % 8 == 0 op_B == cuBLAS_OP_N || n%8 == 0 intptr_t(A) % 16 == 0 intptr_t(B) % 16 == 0 intptr_t(C) % 16 == 0 intptr_t(A+lda) % 16 == 0 intptr_t(B+ldb) % 16 == 0 intptr_t(C+ldc) % 16 == 0 Bandwidth is also a very important factor and is always a key bottleneck in real-life performance. We will see this repeatedly in the next sections. That's why a large bandwidth (fast) memory can be really expensive. In parallel computation, the bandwidth of interconnect interface is more important. Take A40 as an example, the GPU-GPU bandwidth through PCIE can only reach 64 GB/s in the absence of the NVLink. And this speed highly depends on the PCIE configuration of the motherboard. If the motherboard only supports 16 lane PCIE, the bandwidth can only be 32 GB/s. With NVLink, the GPU-to-GPU communication can be much faster, in A40, it can be 112.5GB/s. Note that NVLink only connects 2 GPUs. In a 4-GPU machine, PCIE is still used for GPUs not connected by NVLink. Another configuration is using NVSwitch + NVLinks to connect multiple cards. For example in above right NVIDIA DGX A10 containing 8x NVIDIA A100 GPUs. 12 NVLinks/GPU provide 600 GB/s GPU-to-GPU Bi-directional Bandwidth. 6x NVIDIA NVSwitches give 4.8 TB/s Bi-directional Bandwidth across all GPUs. PCIe 4 doubles the data transfer speed of the previous generation (PCIe 3.0) from 1GB/s per lane to 2GB/s per lane, providing users with a total of 32GB/s in a 16 lane configuration. Furthermore, PCIe provides up to 16GT/s per lane when compared to the previous generation's 8GT/s. Each new generation of PCIe doubles the data transfer rate and total bandwidth per lane of the prior generation, paving the way for new, faster PCIe devices. NVLink is a direct GPU-to-GPU interconnect that scales multi-GPU input/output (IO) within the server. NVSwitch connects multiple NVLinks to provide all-to-all GPU communication at full NVLink speed within a single node and between nodes. NVLink and NVSwitch for NVIDIA Ampere architecture provide extra 600GB/s GPU-to-GPU bandwidth.

The matrix multiplication performance is a main topic in HPC. There are a large number of research papers and libraries. For example, for CPU, BLAS(FORTRAN)/cBLAS(C) is one mainstream API containing all Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and the backend library includes open-sourced ATLAS, OpenBLAS, close-sourced Intel® MKL. For Nvidia GPU, the backend library, cuBLAS, is not open-sourced. You may check cutlass, which claimed similar performance as cuBLAS, for some implementation details. And there is a new coming AI accelerated library openai-gemm only for faster GEMM operations. The example code of TFLOPS of matrix multiplication is shown below. 4 different sizes of square matrices in 3 different precisions are tested. matmul_tflops = defaultdict(lambda: &#123;&#125;) for n in [128, 512, 2048, 8192]: for dtype in (torch.float64, torch.float32, torch.float16): a = torch.randn(n, n, dtype=dtype).cuda() b = torch.randn(n, n, dtype=dtype).cuda() t = walltime(&#x27;a @ b&#x27;, var_dict(a, b)) matmul_tflops[f&#x27;n=&#123;n&#125;&#x27;][dtype] = 2*n**3 / t / 1e12 #* del a, b pd.DataFrame(matmul_tflops) *The number of floating point operations ofmultiplication of two \\(n \\times n\\) matrices: \\(2n^3\\)multiplication of two \\(n-dimension\\) vectors: \\(2n^2\\)For example, the inner product of two vectors \\(a=[a_0, a_1, ... a_n]\\) and \\(b=[b_0, b_1, ... b_n]\\) can be expanded by: \\[&lt;a,b&gt; = a_0*b_0 + a_0*b_1 + a_0*b_2 ... a_n*b_n\\] Although in hardware, one multiplication and one addition are done at once, referring as Multiply–accumulate operation (MAC). But normally, they are treated as two separate floating point operations when calculating FLOPs. A selection of results on different platforms are shown as: A800 n=128 n=512 n=2048 n=8192 Theory Float64 0.45773 (+359.49%) 10.662 (+2430.5%) 17.188 (+3059.44%) 18.023 (+3209.95%) 19.5 (+3407.19%) Float32 0.34396 (-12.28%) 9.7233 (-49.8%) 17.575 (-34.89%) 18.993 (-43.89%) 19.5 (-45.22%) Float16 0.20737 (-49.62%) 18.949 (-30.22%) 201.77 (+242.0%) 257.4 (+242.28%) 312 (+119.72%) 3090 n=128 n=512 n=2048 n=8192 Theory Float64 0.099616 (100.0%) 0.42134 (100.0%) 0.54402 (100.0%) 0.54451 (100.0%) 0.556 (100.0%) Float32 0.3921 (100.0%) 19.37 (100.0%) 26.991 (100.0%) 33.852 (100.0%) 35.6 (100.0%) Float16 0.41158 (100.0%) 27.157 (100.0%) 58.997 (100.0%) 75.201 (100.0%) 142 (100.0%) cpu n=128 n=512 n=2048 n=8192 Standard Float64 0.0975 (-2.09%) 0.09918 (-76.46%) 0.09824 (-81.94%) 0.09729 (-82.1%) N/A Float32 0.1853 (-52.7%) 0.2042 (-98.9%) 0.2080 (-99.2%) 0.2066 (-99.4%) 0.216 (-99.4%) Float16 NAN NAN NAN NAN N/A The general rule can be concluded as: the performance increases with the matrix size i.e. occupancy. a big performance jump is seen when converting from 64-bit floating points to 32-bit floating points, and from 32-bit floating points to 16-bit floating points. the best TFLOPS number ever got is still far away from the theoretical TFLOPS. Because the performance is bottlenecked by the memory bandwidth. From the comparison, we can see that: For A800: it has much higher FLoat64 and Float16 FLOPS than the others the Float32 performance is slightly lower, stick to the theory. Vector multiply a number (SCAL) The number of computations (FLOPs) is only part of the story. Memory bandwidth is the other part, and most of the time is even more important! On current computer architectures, a single memory access from main memory is much slower than a single computation — by a factor of about 100 or more. As a result, the amount of memory read/writes will have a big impact on the speed — bigger perhaps than the FLOPs. In order to test the bandwidth, we designed a task that scales a vector by a constant. The actual scaling operation is as fast as a snap. The main bottleneck is the bandwidth. Element-wised tasks like this are very common, such as the time integrating step in simulations, the activation function layer and model updating process in Neural Networks. Such types of tasks are always ignored when calculating the complexity (FLOPs). But they can be actually very slow.It’s actually common to not count these operations, as they only take up a small fraction of the overall time. We’re mostly interested in the (big) matrix multiplies and dot products, and we’ll simply assume that the activation function is free. We only test on torch (code below) to illustrate the problem. And we only choose precision FP32, because the calculation overhead of large dimension FP64 vector is still big. We are seeking an operation with ignorable calculation overhead compare to the memory access. Besides, FP16 scaling is not supported in cuBLAS, neither level-1 routine cuBLASscal nor BLAS-like routine cuBLASScalEx(). For a more detailed pure bandwidth benchmark, refer to the beginning section of next blog. vector = defaultdict(lambda: &#123;&#125;) for n in [1024*64, 1024*256, 1024*1024, 1024*1024*4]: a = torch.randn(n).cuda() t = walltime(&#x27;a * 1.2&#x27;, var_dict(a)) vector[n][&#x27;TFLOPS&#x27;] = n / t / 1e12 vector[n][&#x27;GB/s&#x27;] = 8 * n / t / 1e9 # ** pd.DataFrame(vector) **The size of \\(n\\) dimensional Float32 vector is \\(4n\\) bits.

From the comparison, the bandwidth of A800 has as much as +114.33% gain from the 3090. GPU state monitoring This task is firstly designed for a wired bug when running GEMM with CUDA. It is not surprising that running cuBLAS directly gives better peak results than the indirect approach i.e. torch calling cuBLAS. However, there is a large drop in performance for Float32, RTX3090, CUDA compared to its torch counterparts. And this result is repeatable. To check the reason, run the same GEMM benchmark again with CUDA and torch on Float32, RTX3090 while recording the GPU state, the result is shown below: ================== CUDA ================== INFO: Running test for all 1 GPU deivce(s) on host tehp1308 ================== INFO: testing GPU0 ================== timestamp, index, name, pcie.link.gen.current, pcie.link.gen.max, pstate, clocks.current.graphics [MHz], clocks.max.graphics [MHz] 2022/12/22 14:26:29.629, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 1, 3, P8, 210 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:26:34.631, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1695 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:26:39.633, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1695 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:26:44.635, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1575 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:26:49.636, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1530 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:26:54.638, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1440 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:26:59.640, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1515 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:27:04.643, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1485 MHz, 2100 MHz cuBLASSgemm test result: 8.5635e-07 1.6361e-05 0.00013088 0.0010519 0.0085015 0.081756 0.29769 2.6873 9.7986 12.518 18.074 16.447 20.891 20.691 ================== TORCH ================== INFO: Running test for all 1 GPU deivce(s) on host tehp1308 ================== INFO: testing GPU0 ================== timestamp, index, name, pcie.link.gen.current, pcie.link.gen.max, pstate, clocks.current.graphics [MHz], clocks.max.graphics [MHz] 2022/12/22 14:42:38.925, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 1, 3, P8, 255 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:42:43.927, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1695 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:42:48.929, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1950 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:42:53.930, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1950 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:42:58.931, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1950 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:03.933, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1950 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:08.934, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1935 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:13.950, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1890 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:18.952, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:23.953, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1740 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:28.954, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1695 MHz, 2100 MHz 2022/12/22 14:43:33.956, 0, GeForce RTX 3090, 3, 3, P2, 1935 MHz, 2100 MHz Pytorch version : 1.8.0+cu111 CUDA version : 11.1 GPU : GeForce RTX 3090 8.5315e-07 1.6369e-05 0.00013096 0.0010552 0.0084168 0.06718 0.39649 2.9674 20.268 27.827 29.288 35.074 35.671 31.058 We can see except for the beginning moment, the range of GPU frequencies are: cuBLAS: [1485, 1695] MHz torch: [1695, 1950] MHz The peak frequency when running cuBLAS directly is the same as the lowest frequency when running torch!

Below are some more information extracted from the GPU state comparison when running GEMM: pcie state pstate freq freq stability A800 4/4 8-0 1410/1410 MHZ high RTX3090 3/3 8-2 1950/2100 MHz low It is worth mentioning that, although the max frequencies of A800 is not comparable with that of RTX3090, the frequency of them stick to the maximum during the entire period of calculation. On the contrary, the frequencies of RTX3090 reaches their peak performances, lower than the max frequency, for a short time then deteriorates because of their less heat dissipation capabilities. Also, the pstate represents to the current performance state of GPU, ranging from P0 max to P12 min. A800 immediately reaches P0 but RTX3090 only reach P2. Maybe that's why the frequency of RTX3090 never reach the highest. There is a way of forcing the graphic card to be P0 state is a kind of overclock, which can cause a crash, I did not try it. See Issues with P-state \"--pstate p0\" on 3080ti &amp; 0.24.8. Last but not least, note that A800 has a higher PCIE state than RTX3090. In fact, RTX3090 supports PCIE 4.0, but the connected CPU and motherboard only supports PCIE 3.0. See Intel® Xeon® Gold 6234 Processor. This means that the A800 has twice the CPU-GPU bandwidth of the RTX3090 per PCIE lane. This is a benefit for multi-GPU computing, especially in the absence of NVLink. Large scale neural networks Now, test the performance of a series of large scale transformer neural networks[1], then split it into pieces to analysis the performance of each kernel. The original interpretation of transformer is a encode-decode structure containing several transformer blocks. Each transformer block contains one (or two in decoder block) multi-head attention layer and a feed forward layer (with residual connection and layer norm layers) as shown below. Define a function to benchmark both forward and forward with backward performance using different sequence lengths and batch sizes: def layer_benchmark(layer, hidden_size, seq_lens, batch_sizes, cross_attention=False): h = hidden_size results = defaultdict(lambda: &#123;&#125;) encoder_state = &#x27;encoder_hidden_states=X&#x27; if cross_attention else &#x27;&#x27; for s in seq_lens: for b in batch_sizes: ffn = 16*b*s*h*h / 1e12 # TFLOPS for the Feed-Forward Network atten = (4*b*h*s*s + 8*b*s*h*h) / 1e12 # TFLOPS for attention forward = ffn + (2 if cross_attention else 1) * atten X = torch.randn(b, s, h).half().cuda() results[f&#x27;batch=&#123;b&#125;&#x27;][f&#x27;fwd seq_len=&#123;s&#125;&#x27;] = forward / walltime( f&#x27;layer(X, &#123;encoder_state&#125;)&#x27;, var_dict(layer, X)) results[f&#x27;batch=&#123;b&#125;&#x27;][f&#x27;fwd+bwd seq_len=&#123;s&#125;&#x27;] = 3 * forward / walltime( f&#x27;layer(X, &#123;encoder_state&#125;)[0].sum().backward()&#x27;, var_dict(layer, X)) return pd.DataFrame(results) Bert The architecture of BERT[2] is a multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder (stage 1-3 in the image above). There are two types of BERT: BERT Base, 12 (Nx) transformer (encoder) blocks, 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters BERT Large, 24 (Nx) transformer (encoder) blocks, 16 attention heads and 340 million parameters BERT large is adopted in this test. The hidden size is 1024, sequence length is chosen from [128, 512], and selected batch sizes are [4, 16, 32, 64], the result is shown below: print(layer_benchmark(layer, config.hidden_size, [128, 512], [4, 16, 32, 64]).to_markdown()) A800_0 batch=4 batch=16 batch=32 batch=64 fwdseq_len=128 19.2772 (+8.7%) 73.497 (+98.49%) 111.482 (+194.8%) 117.696 (+194.67%) fwd+bwdseq_len=128 16.5694 (-30.17%) 88.1707 (+192.16%) 107.347 (+150.18%) 135.874 (+197.25%) fwdseq_len=512 77.2078 (+139.87%) 94.9238 (+171.26%) 97.682 (+171.89%) 101.759 (+178.88%) fwd+bwdseq_len=512 50.4813 (+57.09%) 111.566 (+179.85%) 117.27 (+183.52%) 122.327 (+188.88%) 3090 batch=4 batch=16 batch=32 batch=64 fwdseq_len=128 17.7345 (100.0%) 37.0276 (100.0%) 37.8156 (100.0%) 39.9415 (100.0%) fwd+bwdseq_len=128 23.729 (100.0%) 30.1785 (100.0%) 42.9077 (100.0%) 45.7111 (100.0%) fwdseq_len=512 32.1873 (100.0%) 34.9941 (100.0%) 35.9264 (100.0%) 36.4884 (100.0%) fwd+bwdseq_len=512 32.1356 (100.0%) 39.8661 (100.0%) 41.3627 (100.0%) 42.3451 (100.0%) No surprise that a large batch size helps. But the best TFLOPS number is below the matrix multiplication TFLOPS. In order to see the reason, take A40_0 and inspect the performance on each part of a BERT layer. The hidden size is 1024, sequence length is 128, and batch size is 64. h, b, s = config.hidden_size, 64, 128 X = torch.randn(b, s, h).half().cuda() print(&#x27;Dense layer TFLOPS: %.3f&#x27; % (8*b*s*h*h / 1e12 / walltime( &#x27;layer.intermediate.dense(X)&#x27;, var_dict(layer, X)))) print(&#x27;Dense+Activation TFLOPS: %.3f&#x27; % (8*b*s*h*h / 1e12 / walltime( &#x27;layer.intermediate(X)&#x27;, var_dict(layer, X)))) ffn = 16*b*s*h*h / 1e12 print(&#x27;FFN TFLOPS: %.3f&#x27;%(ffn / walltime( &#x27;layer.output(layer.intermediate(X),X)&#x27;, var_dict(layer, X)))) att = (4*b*h*s*s + 8*b*s*h*h) / 1e12 print(&#x27;Attention TFLOPS: %.3f&#x27;%( att / walltime(&#x27;layer.attention(X)&#x27;, var_dict(layer, X)))) print(att / ffn) Dense layer TFLOPS: 95.531 Dense+Activation TFLOPS: 73.538 FFN TFLOPS: 72.570 Attention TFLOPS: 37.845 0.53125 We first benchmark the first dense layer in the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer. The number of TFLOPS is quite good, 95.510, with a peak GEMM TFLOPS of 101.26. Then run this dense layer with the GeLU activation. Even though the activation function has a negligible complexity (n), it reduces the TFLOPS. The reason is that the elemental-wise operation of the activation function is bounded by the memory bandwidth. Then we test the entire FFN, including the residual block and normalization and the TFLOPS number gains a little bit. The other part of the BERT layer is the multi-head self-attention. Even though the main computation part of the attention block is still matrix multiplication, it has more memory constrained operators compared to FFN. So we see a lower TFLOPS. GPT-2 Instead of encoder, GPT-2[2] takes the decoder part of the original transformer architecture.

And the performance of 3090 nearly reach A40. Also, using a larger sequence length 1024 further harms the performance. T5 T5[2] takes the full transformer architecture. The encoder and decoder performance are tested separately. The performance of encoder is similar to BERT. The decoder has an additional cross attention, which increases the time complexity and also hurts TFLOPS.

For further improvement, we may need to rewrite the code. For example, fusing multiple kernels into a single one. Future The accuracy is not checked in this benchmark.

The modes extracted by the two algorithms are compared on the wide (MINST [28*28, 60000]) and slim (Flow past cylinder snapshots [465*354, 110]) datasets. In addition, several regularization methods to improve the orthogonality and optimality of LAE modes are proposed and tested. Theories The relation between POD and equivalent linear Autoencoder is first identified by M Milano et.al[1]. They use the nonlinear Autoencoder extension for reconstruction and prediction for near wall turbulence flow. And it has been seen as the first application of neural networks into the field of fluid mechanics[2]. POD/PCA and SVD A more detailed description can be found in the last post. Only the essence of it is shown below. Consider a vector space \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\) as \\(\\mathbf{X}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}x^1 &amp; x^2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; x^n\\end{array}\\right]\\), where \\(x^i=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}x^i_1 &amp; x^i_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; x^i_m\\end{array}\\right]^T\\). The reduced-order representation \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\) can be established by POD as: \\[ \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}=\\sum_{i=1}^p \\alpha_i \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\qquad \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, \\mathbf{\\Phi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times n} \\] where the columns of \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}\\) is called modes representing the optimal set of basis spanned by which the reconstructed space \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\) has mathematically the lowest \\(L2\\) loss to the original space \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). These modes can be extracted by SVD (or efficient SVD): \\[ \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V^T},\\qquad \\mathbf{U}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, \\mathbf{V}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n} \\] And the reduced order representation can be reconstructed as: \\[ \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} = \\underbrace{\\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}}\\underbrace{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}^\\mathbf{T}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}},\\qquad \\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times p}, \\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p} \\] where \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}, \\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}\\) is the first \\(p\\) columns of \\(\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{V}\\) respectively. \\(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}\\) is the first \\(p\\) dimensional diagonal sub-matrix of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\). Relating to POD, we have \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}^\\mathbf{T}\\). Linear autoencoder (LAE) One-layer linear neural network (without nonlinear activation function layer) can be concluded with an input data \\(\\mathbf{X_0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\) and the output \\(\\mathbf{X_1}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times n}\\): \\[ \\mathbf{X_1}=\\boldsymbol{W_1}\\mathbf{X_0} + \\mathbf{b_1},\\qquad \\mathbf{X_1}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times n}, \\mathbf{W_1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times m}, \\mathbf{X_0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, \\mathbf{b_1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\text{(broundcast)} \\] As the architecture shown above, a linear autoencoder stacks two of linear layer with a lower dimensional intermediate output acting as a bottleneck, also called the latent space. The first and second layer of the autoencoder are always referred to as the encoder and decoder. With a well trained LAE, the original input data \\(\\mathbf{X_0}\\) can be reconstructed from a latent space \\(\\mathbf{X_1}\\), the error between original data \\(\\mathbf{X_0}\\) and the reconstructed data \\(\\mathbf{X_2}\\) can be minimized regressively via back propagation and gradient descent. When choosing mean square error (MSE) as error/loss function, the optimal latent space extracted by the optimal LAE is identical with that extracted by POD/PCA. Equivalent LAE to POD Straightforward method To get a autoencoder equivalent to POD, set \\(\\mathbf{b_1} = \\mathbf{b_2}=0\\), a straightforward way is to make the auto encoder process \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and reconstruct it as \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\). The mathematical representation is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} layer1: \\qquad \\mathbf{X_1}=\\boldsymbol{W_1}{\\color{purple}\\mathbf{X}},&amp;\\qquad \\mathbf{X_1}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times n}, \\mathbf{W_1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times m}, \\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n} \\\\ layer2: \\qquad {\\color{purple}\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}}=\\boldsymbol{W_2}\\mathbf{X_1},&amp;\\qquad \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, \\mathbf{W_2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p} \\end{aligned} \\] associated with the above symbols, the weights of the second layer are used as the modes i.e. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} &amp;= \\mathbf{W_2} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} &amp;= \\mathbf{X_1} \\end{aligned} \\] Transposition method Although, there is another equivalence, if we make the autoencoder process a transposition of data, we have a bottleneck mapping from \\(\\mathbf{X&#39;}\\) to \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}&#39;\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} layer1: \\qquad \\mathbf{X_1&#39;}=\\boldsymbol{W_1}&#39;{\\color{purple}\\mathbf{X}&#39;},&amp;\\qquad \\mathbf{X_1&#39;}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times m}, \\mathbf{W_1&#39;}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times n}, \\mathbf{X&#39;}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m} \\\\ layer2: \\qquad {\\color{purple}\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}&#39;}=\\boldsymbol{W_2}&#39;\\mathbf{X_1&#39;},&amp;\\qquad \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}, \\mathbf{W_2&#39;}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p} \\end{aligned} \\] In this case, we have the intermediate latent space related to the modes, that is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} &amp;= \\mathbf{X_1&#39;} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}&amp;= \\mathbf{W_2&#39;} \\end{aligned} \\] Improvement Well, those equivalences only exist in imagination because of the large freedom of gradient descend process non-orthogonality: modes extracted by LAE is not necessarily orthogonal non-optimality: (L2) energy preserved by the modes are not ranked in descending order There might be several methods to obtain a set of modes comparable with the POD modes: Two-stage: [method 1] run another SVD on the raw modes extracted by the LAE, it works on both the two methods. End-to-end: Straightforward method [method 2] Orthonormal regularization on the weight [method 3] Orthogonalized the weight every step (parameterization) [method 4] SVD the weight every step (custom SVD parameterization) Transpose method [method 5] Add an SVD layer after the 1st layer output. All these improvements will be compared and tested in the case study section. In this section, the [method 2] regularization methods and the [method 4] SVD parameterization will be further talked about. L2 regularization Before introducing the orthogonal regularization used in [method 2], let's recall the popular L2 regularization. For dataset \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\) as \\(\\mathbf{X}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}x^1 &amp; x^2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; x^n\\end{array}\\right]\\), where \\(x^i=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}x^i_1 &amp; x^i_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; x^i_m\\end{array}\\right]^T\\), the L2 regularized loss function of the 2-layer linear autoencoder is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{(W_1,W_2)}} &amp;= \\mathcal{L}_{ms} + \\mathcal{L}_{L2} \\\\ \\text{where:}\\qquad {\\mathcal{L}_{ms}}_{\\mathbf{(W_1,W_2)}} &amp;= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} MSE(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x^{i}},x^{i}}), \\\\ {\\mathcal{L}_{L2}}_{\\mathbf{(W_1,W_2)}} &amp;=\\frac{\\lambda_{L2}}{2n}\\sum_{l=1}^2 (\\left\\|\\mathbf{W}_{l}\\right\\|^2_F), \\\\ \\left\\|\\mathbf{W}_1\\right\\|^2_F &amp;=\\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{\\mathbf{W}_1}_{i}^{j2} = trace(\\mathbf{W}^T_1\\mathbf{W}_1), \\\\ \\quad \\left\\|\\mathbf{W}_2\\right\\|^2_F &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{\\mathbf{W}_2}_i^{j2} = trace(\\mathbf{W}^T_2\\mathbf{W}_2) \\end{aligned} \\] Normally, the L2 regularization is not applied by tailoring the loss function, but more simply and efficiently, the weight updating process, referring as the weight decay.In the gradient descend algorithm, weights are updated by the gradient of loss function w.r.t. the weights: \\[\\mathbf{W}_l = \\mathbf{W}_l-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial{\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}}}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}_l}\\] With \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{L}} = \\mathcal{L}_{ms} + \\mathcal{L}_{L2}\\), we have: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf{W}_l &amp;= \\mathbf{W}_l-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_{ms}}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}_l}+\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_{L2}}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}_l}\\right) \\\\&amp;= \\mathbf{W}_l-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_{ms}}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}_l}+\\frac{\\lambda_{L2}}{n}\\mathbf{W}_l\\right) \\\\\\end{aligned}\\] And \\(\\lambda_{L2}\\) is called the weight decay parameter, with \\(\\alpha\\) being the learning rate.We can't do such simplification with other regularization methods. Ablation tests on the L2 regularization (weight decay) and learning rate are carried out with MNIST dataset. [method 1] is used to inspect the results. Some interesting results are shown in the Appendix. It turns out that a small L2 regularization leads to more orthogonal modes and lower reconstruction error. Too much L2 regularization leads to high bias/under fitting. Orthonormal regularization One attractive property of the POD modes is the (semi) orthonormality, i.e. the modes are independent with each others i.e. the inner product of the mode matrix is identity. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}&amp;=\\mathbf{I}, \\qquad\\mathbf{I} \\text{ is the identity matrix} \\\\ \\left\\langle \\phi_i, \\phi_j\\right\\rangle &amp;= \\delta_{i j}, \\qquad\\forall i, j \\end{aligned} \\] To impose an orthonormal penalty on the weight of LAE, mimicking the L2 regularization, we can design an orthonormal regularization: \\[ {\\mathcal{L}_{ortho}}_{\\mathbf{(W_1,W_2)}} =\\lambda_{ortho}\\sum_{l=1}^2\\left\\|\\mathbf{W}^T_l\\mathbf{W}_l-\\mathbf{I}\\right\\|^2_F \\] Orthogonal regularization is a technique first proposed in CNNs.Brock et.al first proposed that maintaining an orthogonal weight is desirable when training neural networks. And they proposed the orthogonal regularization in L1 norm [4]. Then they upgraded it to a new variation in BigGAN[5] based on the L2 norm. Lubana et.al[6] applied the same method to the field of neural network pruning[7]. SVD parameterization Parameterization is a method transforming the parameter of neural network in an appropriate way before using it. For example, orthogonal parameterization orthogonalizes the weight matrix of a layer of the neural network. Orthogonal parameterization guarantees a arbitrary orthogonal basis, but we want more. So here it is possible to define a SVD parameterization regulating the the decoder such that: \\[ \\begin{aligned} layer2:&amp; \\qquad \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}=\\boldsymbol{W_2}\\mathbf{X_1}= \\mathbf{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V^T}\\mathbf{X_1} = \\boldsymbol{\\hat{W_2}}\\mathbf{\\hat{X_1}} \\\\ \\text{where:}&amp; \\qquad \\boldsymbol{\\hat{W_2}} = \\mathbf{U}, \\quad \\mathbf{\\hat{X_1}}=\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V^T}\\mathbf{X_1} \\\\ &amp;\\qquad \\mathbf{U},\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma},\\mathbf{V} = SVD(\\boldsymbol{W_2}) \\end{aligned} \\] In this case the modes \\(\\hat{W_2}\\) automatically gets singular value decomposed. Parameterization only affects the weight, i.e. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{W_2}} = \\mathbf{U}\\) not \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{X_1}}=\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V^T}\\mathbf{X_1}\\).The intermediate output \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{X_1}}\\) should be designed in the forwarding process. See the code. Case study MNIST The MNIST handwritten digits dataset contains 70,000 (60,000 training, 1000 testing) greyscale fixed-size (28 * 28) images and is a standard dataset for benchmarking computer vision and deep learning algorithms. import torch from torchvision import datasets, transforms, utils import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np # GPU if is available device = torch.device(&quot;cuda:0&quot; if torch.cuda.is_available() else &quot;cpu&quot;) # device = torch.device(&quot;mps&quot; if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else &quot;cpu&quot;) print(device, &quot; is in use&quot;) # Load MNIST to a PyTorch Tensor dataset = datasets.MNIST(root=&quot;./data&quot;, train=True, download=False, transform=transforms.ToTensor()) POD result In order to run POD , the training set is flattened, scaled to range [0,1] then centred by subtracting the mean image, resulting a data matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{784\\times60000}\\) # Flatten from [60000, 28, 28] to [28*28, 60000], move to gpu flatten_data = dataset.data.reshape(dataset.data.shape[0], -1).type(torch.FloatTensor)/255 mean_data = flatten_data.mean(axis=0) flatten_data = flatten_data - mean_data flatten_data = flatten_data.T.to(device) The PyTorch SVD API is used for extracting POD modes, and the first 81 modes are selected to recover the data # SVD and truncation U, S, V = torch.svd(flatten_data) k = 81 Uk = U[:, :k] # pod modes Sk = torch.diag(S[:k]) # energy Vk = V[:, :k] The memory requirements for direct SVD are high on a dataset of this size. For larger data, such a direct approach is not practical. The energy spectral/division of each mode are shown below: the first 81 modes (in use) captured 89.2% of the total energy the first 87 modes captured 90% of the energy the first 331 modes captured 99% of the energy Estimated data can be reconstructed from the extracted modes and associated weights. The error can be therefore calculated by the \\(L2\\) norm. reconstructed = Uk@Sk@Vk.T print(&quot;MSE loss&quot;, torch.square(reconstructed - flatten_data).mean().cpu().numpy()) SVD reconstructed Error the MSE error is 0.007265054 pixel-to-pixel difference ranges from -0.997 to 0.920 Note in this case, the color mapping ranges are all set to be [-0.2, 0.2] for consistence. The modes can also be extracted easily. Note that these modes are orthonormal. LAE results The straightforward method is adopted, otherwise the size of weights is too large. The architecture is therefore: from torchinfo import summary # ... k = 81 # Creating a AE class # 28*28 ==&gt; k ==&gt; 28*28 class AE(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.encoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(flatten_data.shape[1], k, bias=False)) self.decoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(k, flatten_data.shape[1], bias=False)) def forward(self, x): encoded = self.encoder(x) decoded = self.decoder(encoded) return encoded, decoded # Loss function and optimizer loss_function = torch.nn.MSELoss() optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.005) # Summary summary(model, input_size=(60000, 784)) ========================================================================================== Layer (type:depth-idx) Output Shape Param # ========================================================================================== AE [60000, 81] -- ├─Sequential: 1-1 [60000, 81] -- │ └─Linear: 2-1 [60000, 81] 63,504 ├─Sequential: 1-2 [60000, 784] -- │ └─Linear: 2-2 [60000, 784] 63,504 ========================================================================================== Total params: 127,008 Trainable params: 127,008 Non-trainable params: 0 Total mult-adds (G): 7.62 ========================================================================================== Input size (MB): 188.16 Forward/backward pass size (MB): 415.20 Params size (MB): 0.51 Estimated Total Size (MB): 603.87 ========================================================================================== An iterative mini batch training is implemented with batch_size = 25, epochs = 3. The data reconstructed by LAE and the error of it are shown below. LAE Reconstructed Error MSE loss 0.00777 pixel-to-pixel error ranges from -1.01 to 0.938 Note the optimal least error (error of POD) is not possible to reach because of nature of mini-batch regression. The set of mode is obtained by: modes = np.array(model.decoder[0].weight.data.cpu()) raw modes [method 1] error 0.00777 [method 1] The raw modes constructed by LAE is obviously not identical to that of POD, in order to show the new spaces spanned by these two set of modes are identical/similar, orthonormalized the LAE modes by SVD, we can also get energy spectral (below) and a orthonormalized set of modes (above). The singular values of each orthonormalized mode are more similar to each other, implying the orthogonality of the raw modes extracted by LAE is stronger, but still far from orthogonal. The orthonormalized modes are, well, not quite same to that extracted by POD. So we do a small scale convergence check, taking some tricks (bigger batch size, learning rate scheduler etc) to have a better reconstruction result with MSE loss 0.0072723706, applying the similar process to get a orthonormalized set of modes. [method 1] error 0.007272370 SVD, error 0.007265054 The better equivalence (at least in terms of the first 2 modes) indicating the space spanned by LAE converges to that spanned by POD modes. [method 2] In order to apply orthogonal weights, first initialize the weight with radom orthogonal data. from scipy.stats import ortho_group # define flatten data, LAE, k = 81 model.encoder[0].weight = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(ortho_group.rvs(dim=flatten_data.shape[0])[:,:k].T).float()) model.decoder[0].weight = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(ortho_group.rvs(dim=flatten_data.shape[0])[:,:k]).float()) Then add another orthogonal losses to the MSE loss function ortho_lambd = 0.01 # in the iteration loop: loss_ortho_de = torch.square(torch.dist(model.decoder[0].weight.T @ model.decoder[0].weight, torch.eye(k).to(device))) loss_ortho_en = torch.square(torch.dist(model.encoder[0].weight @ model.encoder[0].weight.T, torch.eye(k).to(device))) loss = loss_function(reconstructed, image) + ortho_lambd*(loss_ortho_de+loss_ortho_en) The resulting modes and the singular value energy division is: [method 2] raw error 0.007268394 [method 1] of [method 2] MSE loss 0.007268394 pixel-to-pixel error ranges from -0.99917483 to 0.91432786 The modes is nearly orthogonal yet it needs a good fine tuning of \\(\\lambda_{ortho}\\) to balance the MSE error with the orthogonality error. Neither the raw [method 2] modes nor the SVD orthogonalized modes associated to the POD modes, we will talk about that soon later. [method 3] Take advantage of the torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.orthogonal library, when define the LAE: class AE(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() + self.encoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.orthogonal(torch.nn.Linear(flatten_data.shape[1], k, bias=False))) + self.decoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.orthogonal(torch.nn.Linear(k, flatten_data.shape[1], bias=False))) - self.encoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(flatten_data.shape[1], k, bias=False)) - self.decoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(k, flatten_data.shape[1], bias=False)) def forward(self, x): encoded = self.encoder(x) decoded = self.decoder(encoded) return encoded, decoded The the singular value energy division and resulting modes are: [method 3] raw error 0.0072978497 [method 1] of [method 3] MSE loss 0.0072978497 pixel-to-pixel error ranges from -0.9987151 to 0.9268836 The modes is perfect orthogonal, the loss is also small. But the [method 2,3] modes are totally different from the POD modes. Because there is no regulation of the singular value of the modes, i.e. the optimality is not guaranteed. [method 4] ( best ) Writing a custom parameterization class and apply to the decoder weights as: class Svd_W_de(nn.Module): def forward(self, W2): U,_,_ = torch.svd(W2) return U torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.parametrize.register_parametrization(model.decoder[0], &quot;weight&quot;, Svd_W_de()) Tailer the network as class AE(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.encoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.orthogonal(torch.nn.Linear(flatten_data.shape[1], k, bias=False))) self.decoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(k, flatten_data.shape[1], bias=False)) def forward(self, x): encoded = self.encoder(x) + _,S,V = torch.svd(self.decoder[0].parametrizations.weight.original) + encoded = encoded@V@torch.diag(S) decoded = self.decoder(encoded) return encoded, decoded The results are: [method 4] raw error 0.007290172 [method 1] of [method 4] MSE loss 0.007290172 pixel-to-pixel error ranges from -1.005479 to 0.9235858 Great! The result is guaranteed as orthogonal and optimal, the error is small, and the model is end-to-end. Flow past a cylinder Flow over a 2D cylinder is the fundamental flow that captures the essential features of bluff-body flows. The periodic nature of it known as the von Kármán vortex shedding at Re&gt;47 is always treated as an attractive initial test bed for decomposition methods. The POD result of the DNS simulation snapshots at Re=100 is shown below, the first 8 modes captures 99.97% of the flow fluctuations in terms of the KE.[3]. Note that these modes appear in pairs because of the periodical flow field and the real value nature of POD modes. Also note that the first two dominant modes are top-down asymmetry, associated with the asymmetry of the flow field. Compared with dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), 2 POD modes in a pair are concluded by the real and imaginary parts of only one complex DMD mode. In another words, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and the 2nd, 4th, 6th POD modes are identical with the real parts and imaginary parts of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd DMD modes respectively. (only true for exact periodical flow like this case) For simplicity, here we take an unsteady FVM result at Re=200, from wolfdynamics OpenFOAM turtorial and perform POD and LAE decomposition based on the snapshots of velocity field from time 250 to 350. The resulting data matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{192080 \\times 101}\\) # Load the fluid Dataset, flattened from [392, 490, 351] to [192080, 351] flatten_data = load_img_as_matrix(&quot;./data/cylinder&quot;) mean_data = flatten_data[250:,:].mean(axis=0) flatten_data = flatten_data - mean_data flatten_data = torch.tensor(flatten_data.T[:,250:]) POD result Follow the process of last case, the energy spectral/division of each mode: First 2 modes capture 76.95% of energy First 4 modes capture 86.81% of energy First 6 modes capture 88.61% of energy First 8 modes capture 89.51%of energy And the original, reconstructed, error results are MSE loss 7.4397925e-05 pixel-to-pixel error ranges from -0.1370289 to 0.12152482 The first 8 dominant POD modes are shown bleow: Note the modes looks very similar to the standard result at the beginning of this case at Re = 100. LAE results Straightforward ( FAILED ) With straightforward method, it is really difficult for autoencoder to converge, and the model is prone to gradient vanishing because of the big data size compared with the length of data. print(&quot;shape of dataset:&quot;, flatten_data.shape) summary(model, input_size=(101, 192080)) print(&quot;encoder weight shape: &quot;, model.encoder[0].weight.shape) print(&quot;decoder weight shape: &quot;, model.decoder[0].weight.shape) shape of dataset: torch.Size([101, 192080]) ========================================================================================== Layer (type:depth-idx) Output Shape Param # ========================================================================================== AE [101, 8] -- ├─Sequential: 1-1 [101, 8] -- │ └─Linear: 2-1 [101, 8] 1,536,640 ├─Sequential: 1-2 [101, 192080] -- │ └─Linear: 2-2 [101, 192080] 1,536,640 ========================================================================================== Total params: 3,073,280 Trainable params: 3,073,280 Non-trainable params: 0 Total mult-adds (M): 310.40 ========================================================================================== Input size (MB): 77.60 Forward/backward pass size (MB): 155.21 Params size (MB): 12.29 Estimated Total Size (MB): 245.10 ========================================================================================== encoder weight shape: torch.Size([8, 192080]) decoder weight shape: torch.Size([192080, 8]) reconstructed error raw modes [method 1] The fluid data FAILs being recovered, the repetitive pattern shown on the recovered images is the mean flow. Compared the recovered orthonormal modes extracted by straightforward AE with POD modes, only the first dominant POD mode is barely captured with low amplitude (note the data range difference), indicating a gradient vanishing. Transposition [method 1] To take advantage of the better performance of neural network on large data length, and to prevent the overfitting and gradient vanishing, transpose the flattened data and make LAE compress it in terms of the data length dimension.

Note the data range for the raw mode is different (-0.4~0.4 instead of -0.04~0.04) [method 5] ( FAILED ) The easiest way is applying SVD to the bottleneck feature every step as: class AE(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.encoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(flatten_data.shape[1], k, bias=False)) self.decoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(k, flatten_data.shape[1], bias=False)) def forward(self, x): encoded = self.encoder(x) + svd_encoded,_,_ = torch.svd(encoded) decoded = self.decoder(encoded) - return encoded, decoded + return svd_encoded, decoded This operation has no advantage but 3 drawbacks: Exactly identical to the result of [method 1] in full batch training. But the resulting mode is wrong with mini-batch gradient descend. This operation does not affect the training process. It is computational heavier than [method 1] as the latter only requires one singular value decomposition step Another way is to pass the \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) (svd_encoded) to the decoder and multiplying the weight by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V^T}\\), mimicking [method 4]. class AE(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.encoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(flatten_data.shape[1], k, bias=False)) self.decoder = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(k, flatten_data.shape[1], bias=False)) self.SVT = torch.zeros((k,k)) def forward(self, x): encoded = self.encoder(x) svd_encoded,S,V = torch.svd(encoded) decoded = self.decoder(svd_encoded) self.SVT = V@torch.diag(S) return svd_encoded, decoded class Svd_W_de(nn.Module): def __init__(self, SVT): super().__init__() self.SVT = SVT def forward(self, X): return X.to(device)@self.SVT.to(device) # Model Initialization model = AE() torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.parametrize.register_parametrization(model.decoder[0], &quot;weight&quot;, Svd_W_de(model.SVT)) This operation has no advantage but 2 vital drawbacks: Cannot be trained The resulting mode is wrong with mini-batch gradient descend As a result, [method 5] is therefore deprecated. Conclusion When to use linear autoencoder? When data is big, the latent space can be well captured with a much lower memory requirement. When offline training is impractical, for example when new data coming through constantly. The relationship between LAE and POD modes? There is no regulation to the form of LAE modes while the POD modes are orthonormal which is suitable to design a sparse representation. The latent space captured by LAE converges to the optimal space spanned by POD modes. Straightforward vs transposition LAE? It mainly depends on the aspect ratio of input data. In order to decrease the number of weights/parameters, it is better to choose a type such that the longer dimension of data is preserved. Straightforward method suitable for very wide data, like MNIST. Transposition method for very thin data like flow velocity snapshots. If a multi-layer non-linear Autoencoder is applied, the modes extracted by the transposed AE are still easy to get access Conclusion on the improvement methods? [method1] [method2] [method3] [method4] [method5] note suitable LAE both straightforward straightforward straightforward transposition end-to-end ❌ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ orthogonality of the modes perfect nearly perfect perfect perfect perfect optimality ✅ ❌ ❌ ✅ ❌ converge to the POD modes ✅ ❌ ❌ ✅ ❌ reconstruction error (straightforward) 7.272e-3 7.268e-3 7.298e-3 7.290e-3 NAN POD error 7.265e-3 reconstruction error (transposition) 7.48e-5 NAN NAN NAN 7.03e-4 POD error 7.44e-05 Appendix Ablation test of L2 regularization of LAE on MNIST Different weight decay and learning rate are applied, and the raw modes are inspected by [method 1]. For learning rate \\(\\alpha = 0.005\\), the energy spectral and division for weight decay \\(\\lambda\\) from \\(0.005\\) to \\(0\\) are plotted animately as below: and the raw modes and orthogonal modes recovered by [method 1] are shown below: The MSE error and the range of the mode value is plotted with the weight decay and learning rate as well: As we can see, learning rate does not affect the mean square error, but the range of the mode value. And weight decay can be used to control the modes' orthogonality, a suitable weight decay for example \\(8e-5\\) results in a better orthogonality and the recovered modes (shown below)· shows a better resemblance of the POD modes. Besides, it is interesting to see that although the biggest weight decay \\(0.005\\) fail to recover most of the modes, the raw modes are very similar to the its recovered modes, like a shuffled version of many copies of the recovered modes regardless the magnitude difference.

Intuitive Introduction Better than Linear regression Linear regression is a widely used method seeking the 'best' linear relation between two input and output variables, say \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). As shown below, there is a difference between the linear regression results considering input as \\(x\\) output as \\(y\\) and the other way around. The difference between the actual value of \\(y\\) and the predicted value for a few samples are plotted as well. The reason of the difference is shown clearly. The direction along which the (Ordinary Least Squares) error is minimized is different in different coordinates. If the two coordinates are correlated with each other, then typically regression outputs become sensitive to noise. If we develop a algorithm to find a new set of coordinates such that as least orthogonal error as possible is in one direction of the new coordinate system, we can have a better regression. Unluckily we have this method, called PCA. As shown below, the orthogonal error to the model line is minimized. The result comparison is shown below, not surprisingly the PCA \"regression\" is in between of the two traditional results. Coordinate shifting and weighted inner production is ignored, i.e. the variable is normalized. PCA and model reduction Slightly different from last subsection, intuatively, what PCA does is to find a rotation of the coordinate s.t. as much variance as possible is represented in one direction of the new coordinate system. Actually the main area of PCA is not regression, but the model reduction. In a random system, the variance means information. And according to the intuitive definition, PCA holds the most variance, as well as the most information in one direction. So if one wants to represent/approximate the data in an 1D coordinate, instead of 2D as before. The best coordinate is the dominant direction found by PCA. And what they do next is projecting the 2D data onto the coordinate. Of course, nobody reduces data from 2D to 1D, usually people are talking about reduce order in the contexts of M dimension vector space -&gt; N (100-1000) dimension vector space M dimension random variables -&gt; N (100-1000) dimension random variables Infinite dimension space (Hilbert space) -&gt; finite dimension system Discretization of PDE And the method is renamed as SVD, PCA, POD, and {spectral, spectral collocation, spectral-element, and finite-element}, in above contexts respectively. But the underlying ideas are the same. Technically, SVD dentoes the algorithm used by PCA and POD to find the basis of the decomposition. For the diecretization methods, a human defined basis is selected, instead of obtained by SVD as before.Here are more names for SVD in other fields: Hotelling analysis, empirical component analysis, quasiharmonic modes, empirical eigenfunction decomposition and so on.For more of information: see Ref.[8] and Ref.[9]. Model reduction Same approaches can be generalized as: define inner product define representation in subspace spanned by orthogonal basis/trail vectors and the resultant residual/error compared to the original space define test/weight vectors and require them orthogonal (or oblique orthogonal) to the error (let the inner product of the test vector and the error equals to 0) rearranging and define the representations of basis, parameters, and projection matrix We are going to apply this process on different kinds of spaces. Finite dimensional vector space Consider a vector space \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m\\) as \\(\\mathbf{X}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; x_m\\end{array}\\right]^T\\) inner product of arbitrary vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is defined simply as: \\[ (\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v})=\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{u} \\] The reduced-order representation of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is always defined as: \\[ \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}=\\sum_{i=1}^p \\alpha_i \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\qquad \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, \\mathbf{\\Phi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p} \\] where the basis \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}\\phi_1 &amp; \\phi_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\phi_p\\end{array}\\right]\\) And the error is considered as: \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{X}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}, \\qquad \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m} \\] note that \\(n\\) dimensional does not expand the \\(m\\) dimensional space. Unless \\(m=p\\), we cannot make the error zero everywhere. The exact equality requirment can be loosened by introducing a test vector as shown below. Define a set of \\(p\\) test/weight vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\), and require them to be orthogonal to the residual (error), letting the inner product of the test vecror and the error equals to 0 \\[ (\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}, \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})=\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} =0,\\qquad \\mathbf{\\Psi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p} \\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}\\psi_1 &amp; \\psi_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\psi_p\\end{array}\\right]\\) refers to the plane that the system is projected to. We require the error to be zero in the projected sub space, instead of exact zero error everywhere. rearranging the last representation: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T(\\mathbf{X}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}) &amp;=0 \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\mathbf{X} &amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\end{aligned} \\] Note that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) must be non-singular i.e. the null space of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) cannot be in the subspace \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\). continue \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\mathbf{X}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\mathbf{X}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\\\ \\mathbf{P X}&amp;=\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\\\ \\text { where } \\mathbf{P}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\end{aligned} \\] \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) refers to the projection matrix, projecting \\(m\\) dimensional space into \\(p\\) dimensional sub space. Note the projection matrix holds the property as \\(\\mathbf{P}^2=\\mathbf{P}\\) Now we can gathered what we have so far: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\\\ \\mathbf{P X}&amp;=\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\\\ \\text { where } \\mathbf{P}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\\\ \\text { and } \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} &amp;=\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\mathbf{X} \\end{aligned} \\] Treat this as a system of functions, since we know \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the system is closed if we define the test function \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\) and the basis \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}\\). There are several ways of choosing \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\), here we only present one of them. Orthogonal/Galerkin projection, letting \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) i.e. letting error \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\) orthogonal to the subspace \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) Orthonormal basis, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) is chosen as orthonormal i.e. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}=\\mathbf{I}\\) In this case, the representation \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\) are simplified as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{P}^\\bot&amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} &amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T \\mathbf{X} \\end{aligned} \\] Galerkin projection has some very good properties: minimum length (norm) of the error \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^T\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) based on the basis same as the standard least square solution to the over-constrained (inconsistent) system Still, there is an infinite number of orthonormal basis we can choose (Fourier expansion for example). But one optimal set of basis is called the (left) singular vector, can be obtained by singular vector decomposition SVD (what shown in the introduction section), where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}U_1 &amp; U_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; U_p\\end{array}\\right]\\) is the basis (i.e. first \\(p\\) columns of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\)) and the corresponding parameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}^T = \\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}^T\\mathbf{X}\\) if orthogonally projecting vector space \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) into subspace \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) Note in SVD, \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) (and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\)) is unitary, as a result, if \\(m=p\\), \\(\\mathbf{P}=\\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}=\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\) SVD finds the subspace \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) that maximizes the individual element of the approximation of the matrix, good for model reduction as The best approximation to a matrix (Frobenius norm) for a given rank is given by a projection into a subspace spanned by the first \\(p\\) columns of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) POD/PCA examples Here are POD analysis on two similar fluid related scenarios. We can see the flow field can be reconstructed by a small number of modes. More fascinatingly, we can see a strong resembleness of the extracted modes between these two cases, indicating a similarity of the underlying coherent structres of nearly laminar and high turbulent flows. Note the instantaneous flow fields represents a stack of snapshotes, instead of one picture. POD/PCA technique is applied in a large varity of fields including fundamental analysis of fluids flows, reduced\u0002order modeling, data compression/reconstruction, flow control, and aerodynamic design optimization. See Section III of Ref.[1]. Generalization The real space \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) can be generalized seamlessly to complex space \\(\\mathbb{C}^m\\) within which the transpose of a real value vector space \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) as \\(\\mathbf{v}^T\\)becomes the Hermitian/conjugate transpose of a complex value vector as \\(\\mathbf{v}^*\\) The inner product can be generalized to be weighted inner product as (in complex value space) \\[ (\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v})_{\\mathbf{w}}=\\mathbf{v}^* \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{u} \\] where the weighting matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) inside the inner product is symmetric and positive definite As a result the weighted projection matrix becomes: \\[ \\mathbf{P}=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^* \\mathbf{W} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^* \\mathbf{W} \\] Resulting in the orthogonal projection \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) to be an oblique projection as \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}=\\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) Random variables Lets change our context back to that of the introduction section: Consider a set of random variables \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m\\) as \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; x_m\\end{array}\\right]^T\\) In order to reduce the order of the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), first we need to build a data matrix based on \\(n\\) observations of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), such that \\[ \\mathbf{X}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}\\mathbf{x^1} &amp; \\mathbf{x^2} &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\mathbf{x^n}\\end{array}\\right] \\] Note: \\(rank(\\mathbf{X})\\leq min(m,n)\\)Typical in statistics: \\(n \\gg m\\)Typical in fluid dynamics \\(m \\ll n\\)The inequality holds for repeated observations (duplicate columns) or with linear dependencies amongst data points (linear combinations of rows) Center the data matrix by subtracting by the sampled expected/mean value \\[ \\mathbf{X_c}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n-1}}\\left[\\begin{array}{llll} \\mathbf{x}^1-\\overline{\\mathbf{x}} &amp; \\mathbf{x}^2-\\overline{\\mathbf{x}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{x}^n-\\overline{\\mathbf{x}} \\end{array}\\right] \\] where \\(\\overline{\\mathbf{x}}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\mathbf{x}^k\\) It is possible to get the expect value via integration over the probability space, but theoretically Then we can project it into a subspace, using the basis obtained by SVD (called PCA in this context) of the centered data matrix. The projection process is well illustrated above. Here we only talked about another benefit of the basis obtained by PCA. Recal efficient SVD and the projection relationship, we set \\(p=rank(\\mathbf{X})=rank(\\mathbf{U1})\\) so that no information truncation is performed, we map the data matrix in terms of a \"full\" order space, i.e. a rotation of the coordinate. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{X_c}&amp;=\\mathbf{U_1}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma_1}\\mathbf{V^*_1}\\\\ \\mathbf{U_1}\\mathbf{U_1}^*\\mathbf{X_c}&amp;=\\tilde{\\mathbf{X_c}} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Take the sampled covariance of the varible as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{C_s} &amp;= \\mathbf{X_c}\\mathbf{X^*_c}=\\mathbf{U_1}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma^2_1}\\mathbf{U^*_1} \\\\ \\mathbf{U^*_1}\\mathbf{C_s}\\mathbf{U_1} &amp;= \\tilde{\\mathbf{X_c}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{X^*_c}} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma^2_1}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] We can see columns of \\(\\mathbf{U_1}\\) are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, more importantly, after projection, the sampled covariance of the resultant varibles are diagonal, meas the resultant variables are un-correlated. Naturally, we can concludes that PCA Maximizes the total variance (trace of the covariance matrix) in the subspace Minimizes the mean-square error between vectors in the original space and their projections (approximations) in the subspace We can still change the inner product as weighted production, in order to scale the variables into same unit. Infinite dimensional (function) space Consider a Hilbert space \\(L2([a,b])\\), we use the same process as before. But the basis function is not chosen by SVD/PCA/POD. Weighted inner product of two complex functions \\(f(\\xi), g(\\xi)\\) are: \\[ (f(\\xi), g(\\xi))_w=\\int_a^b f(\\xi) g^*(\\xi) w(\\xi) d \\xi, \\quad w(\\xi) \\geq 0 \\] For a function \\(x(t, \\xi)\\), we can represented it into a finite dimensional space spanned by a set of basis/trail functions, \\[ \\phi_j(t, \\xi), \\qquad j=1,2,\\dots, p \\] such that reduced order function \\(\\tilde{x}(t, \\xi)\\) in the sub space can be expressed as: \\[ \\tilde{x}(t, \\xi)=\\sum_{j=1}^p \\alpha_j \\phi_j(t, \\xi) \\] Morden method decompose the function such that the space and time is split. \\[\\tilde{x}(t, \\xi)=\\sum_{j=1}^p \\alpha_j(t) \\phi_j(\\xi)\\] Consider test functions \\[ \\psi_j(t, \\xi), \\qquad j=1,2,\\dots, p \\] and the wighted function of error is such that \\[ (\\epsilon(t, \\xi), \\psi_j(t, \\xi))_w=\\int_a^b \\epsilon(t, \\xi) \\psi^*_j(t, \\xi) w(t, \\xi) d \\xi = 0 \\] as a result: \\[ \\left(\\tilde{x}, \\psi_j\\right)_w-\\sum_i \\alpha_i\\left(\\phi_i, \\psi_j\\right)_w=0, \\quad j=1,2, \\ldots, p \\] rearranging: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{r} &amp;= \\mathbf{M} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\\\ \\text{where: }\\{\\mathbf{r}\\}_j &amp;=\\left(\\tilde{x}, \\psi_j\\right) \\\\ \\{\\mathbf{M}\\}_{j i} &amp;=\\left(\\phi_i, \\psi_j\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Still here leaves several choices of test functions and basis functions: Choice of test functions Galerkin method/orthogonal projection, finite element Collocation method (non-orthogonal), finite difference Step function, finite volume Choice of basis function Fourier series / Trigonometric series, spectral methods Polynomials Global, usually Chebyshev poly Local, e.g. Piecewise Polynomials linear \"hat/tent function\" (finite element) higher order (spectral element) Generally to be computationally efficient, we want the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) to be sparse \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is diagonal for Galerkin with orthogonal basis functions \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is sparse (banded) for Galerkin/collocation with piecewise polynomials \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is diagonal for bi-orthogonal function Discretization methods of PDE The discretization methods of a PDE is basically mapping a dynamic system (PDE) from Hilbert space into finite dimensional space, just as illustrated above. As a result, in this section, same methods is applied on an example. Consider a 1D Poisson equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{L}(u) \\equiv \\nabla^2u = f(\\xi) &amp;\\qquad\\text{in } \\Omega = \\{\\xi | 0 &lt; \\xi &lt; 1\\} \\\\ u(0)=\\mathcal{g_D}, &amp;\\qquad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\xi}(1)=\\mathcal{g_N} \\end{aligned} \\] with a solution \\(u\\) in Hilbert space. \\(u\\) is denotes the data variable, instead of \\(x\\) as before. \\(\\xi\\) represents the spatial coordinatesPoisson equation is a typical elliptic PDE Inner production in domain \\(\\Omega\\) \\[ (f(\\xi), g(\\xi))=\\int_{\\Omega} f(\\xi) g(\\xi) d \\xi \\] We have a reduced order solution \\(\\tilde{u}(\\xi)\\) in \\(N\\) dimensional space spanned by basis \\(\\phi_i(\\xi)\\): \\[ \\tilde{u}(\\xi)=\\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{u}_i \\phi_i(\\xi) \\] and therefore \\[ \\tilde{\\mathbb{L}}(\\tilde{u}(\\xi)) = \\nabla^2\\tilde{u} \\] and the error/residual: \\[ \\epsilon = \\tilde{\\mathbb{L}}-\\mathbb{L}= \\nabla^2\\tilde{u} - f(\\xi) \\] Consider a \\(N\\) dimensional test function \\(\\Psi\\) spanned by \\(\\psi_i(\\xi)\\), and consider inner production of test function and error function: \\[ (\\Psi(\\xi), \\epsilon(\\xi))= \\int_{\\Omega} \\Psi(\\xi) (\\tilde{\\mathbb{L}}(\\tilde{u}(\\xi))-f(\\xi)) d \\xi = 0 \\] Above is called the weak formulation. Similar to the test vector, the test function release the \"strict\" requirement of an exact solution everywhere. We are going to use the finite element, so we choose the basis as a set of local linear tent functions as: \\[ \\psi_i(\\xi)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\xi-\\xi_{i-1}}{\\xi_i-\\xi_{i-1}} &amp; \\text { if } \\xi \\in\\left[\\xi_{i-1}, \\xi_i\\right] \\\\ \\frac{x_{i+1}-\\xi}{\\xi_{i+1}-\\xi_i} &amp; \\text { if } \\xi \\in\\left[\\xi_i, \\xi_{i+1}\\right] \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases} \\] In such a basis, the solution is required to be exact only locally in each cell. For test function, we use Galerkin formulation as \\[ \\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) =\\phi_j \\] Different test/weight functions lead to different methods of discretization \\[\\begin{aligned}&amp;\\text { Test functions used in the method of weighted residuals}\\\\&amp;\\begin{aligned}\\hline &amp; \\text { Test function } &amp; &amp; \\text { Type of method } \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp;\\\\\\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) &amp;=\\delta\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}-\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_j\\right) &amp; &amp; \\text { Collocation/Finite Difference } \\\\\\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) &amp;=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{llll}1 &amp; \\text { inside } &amp; \\Omega^j \\\\0 &amp; \\text { outside } &amp; \\Omega^j\\end{array}\\right.&amp; &amp; \\text { Finite volume (subdomain） } \\\\\\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) &amp;=\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\hat{u}_j} &amp; &amp;\\text { Least-squares} \\\\\\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) &amp;=\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^j &amp; &amp; \\text { Method of moments } \\\\\\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) &amp;=\\phi_j &amp; &amp; \\text { Galerkin } \\\\\\psi_j(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) &amp;\\neq \\phi_j &amp; &amp; \\text { Petrov-Galerkin moments } \\\\\\hline\\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\] Weak formulation of Poisson equation Now add some details, the weak formulation in step 3 should be: \\[ \\int_{0}^1 (\\nabla^2\\tilde{u}-f(\\xi))\\Psi(\\xi) d\\xi = 0 \\] Use the integration by parts rule: \\[ \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\xi} d \\xi=\\int_0^1 \\psi f d \\xi+\\left[\\psi \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\xi}\\right]_0^1 \\] Implementation of boundary conditions As \\(\\psi(0)=0\\), apply the Neumann boundary condition \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\xi}(1)=\\mathcal{g_N}\\) directly, \\[ \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\xi} d \\xi=\\int_0^1 \\psi f d \\xi+\\psi(1) {\\mathcal{g_N}} \\] For the Dirichlet boundary \\(u(0)=\\mathcal{g_D}\\), it cannot be implemented directly. Instead, this can treat as an inhomogeneity part of the solution, such as: \\[ \\tilde{u}=\\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{H}+\\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{D} \\] where \\(\\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{H}\\) and \\(\\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{D}\\) denote the homogenize and inhomogenize part respectively, and we have: \\[ \\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{H}(0) = 0 \\qquad \\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{D}(0) = \\mathcal{g_D} \\] Plug into the formulation as: \\[ \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{H}}{\\partial \\xi} d \\xi + \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{D}}{\\partial \\xi} d \\xi=\\int_0^1 \\psi f d \\xi+\\psi(1) {\\mathcal{g_N}} \\] As a result, the finite element form of the PDE is: \\[ \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{H}}{\\partial \\xi} d \\xi =\\int_0^1 \\psi f d \\xi+\\underbrace{\\psi(1) {\\mathcal{g_N}}}_{Neumann} - \\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}^\\mathcal{D}}{\\partial \\xi} d\\xi }_{Dirichlet} \\] And the \\(\\tilde{u}\\) can be solved by solving the ODE. In the \\(h-type\\) method a fixed order polynomial is used in every element and convergence is achieved by reducing the size of the elements. \\(h\\) represents the characteristic size of an element.In the \\(p-type\\) method a fixed mesh is used and convergence is achieved by increasing the order of the polynomial every element. \\(p\\) represents the polynomial order in the elements.In the \\(spectral\\) method is the \\(p-type\\) method but the whole solution domain is treated as a single element.The \\(hp-element\\) method combines attributes from both of these methods.

This is a crash introduction of turbulence and RANs, if need further information, here are some useful references. Most of the concepts, formulas, figures of this blog are collected from these resources:note: Viscous Flows and Turbulence - profs.scienze.univr.itslides: Turbulence modeling in OpenFOAM and general CFD - Advanced trainingvideo: Turbulence Closure Models: Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) &amp; Large Eddy Simulations (LES)book: The structure of turbulent shear flow [7] Turbulence Introduction The Nature of Turbulent Flow Turbulent flow is characterised by: Three-dimensionality. Turbulence is inherently three-dimensional. Although some people study two-dimensional turbulence (this may have some application to geophysical flows (see figure 6.1). Note that the “stretching and tilting” term in the vorticity transport equation is absent in two-dimensional flows, and therefore two-dimensional turbulence is considerably simpler than the real-life three-dimensional variety. Time-dependency. Turbulence is characterised by unsteady variations in velocity, density, temperature or concentration, and the variation (fluctuations) occurs over a wide range of time scales. Turbulence has a broad frequency spectrum. A wide range of length scales. Turbulence has a broad wavenumber spectrum. If we consider the example of turbulent pipe flow, a range of scales which goes from the largest (of order \\(D\\), the pipe diameter) to the smallest (of order \\(ν/u_\\tau\\), where \\(u_\\tau\\) is the friction velocity, which is a velocity scale based on the wall shear stress: it is of the same order as a typical velocity fluctuation) Effective mixing of all fluid properties. Study Turbulence Historically, studies of turbulence have relied on a very restricted set of “tools”: Approximate analysis of average properties of highly idealized turbulent flows (eg. grid turbulence); Analysis of idealized linear stability problems; Measurements of time-averaged properties and ensemble-average properties (\\(\\bar{U}, \\bar{U&#39;^2}, \\bar{U&#39;v&#39;}, \\Psi(\\omega), p(u)\\), etc.); Flow visualization; Dimensional analysis and scaling arguments. From this work we have obtained a small set of widely accepted “facts”, for example, the logarithmic variation of velocity in a turbulent boundary layer; a small set of widely accepted correlations, for example the friction factor for pipes as a function of Reynolds number; a small set of widely accepted theories eg. Kolmogoroff’s inertial range, Batchelor’s final decay of grid turbulence; a qualitative notion of energy transfer (the energy cascade); the kinematics and other general features of turbulence and eddies, for example the role of bulges, horshoe-vortices, “typical” eddies, etc.; some useful but rather restricted sets of predictive tools, for example, the k-ε turbulence model; a good appreciation of scaling arguments. The difficulty is: Turbulence is complex. Extremely complex. The main goal is: To develop approximations to the N-S equations which embody sufficient dynamical information to allow reliable and efficient predictions of turbulent flows. We need: high quality simulations; high quality experiments; good ideas. Approaches to Turbulence The major varieties are the time-averaged approach (also called Reynolds averaged approach); ensemble-averaged approach; instantaneous realisation approach Reynolds-averaged most common approach most studied most limited in terms of understanding form the basis of all engineering calculation methods idea turbulence is seen as a purely statistical phenomena N-S equations are written in terms of mean quantities by using time averages turbulence model is incorporated to close the model Ensemble-averaged a way of thinking, rather than a parallel approach to RANs idea turbulence has an underlying structure instead of randomness similarity among eddies, determine the average properties of an eddy, and how these properties scale with size, position, etc take some of the turbulent structure into account Examples see phase-averaging (Cantwell &amp; Coles[1] Perry &amp; Tan[2]) and VITA[3] approach (Spina &amp; Donovan[4]). Instantaneous realisation a way of thinking, again one can do this in experiments (e.g. PIV (Particle-Image Velocimetry)) or simulations. idea understand turbulence by looking at individual events picking out features which occur often (link to ensemble-averaged approach above) looking at a relatively small number of events see Robinson's work[5]. Note that these 3 approaches can be used together by researchers, there are no cut line among these. What is structure in turbulence?Turbulence usually displays departures from Gaussian behavior - these departures may be called structure, and might be embodied in terms of the moments of the pdf’s of \\(u&#39;, v&#39;\\) and \\(w&#39;\\)A description of individual eddying motions in the turbulence. Also called coherent structures ” if they represent some sort of entity which can be followed in time. Reynolds-Averaged Equations Example: Turbulent channel flow Consider the above channel flow at high Reynolds number ( \\(Re &gt;&gt; 2000\\), where \\(Re = U_{av}h/\\nu\\) ). The pressure drop driving the flow is assumed to be steady. At any point in the flow, the magnitude of the velocity in all three directions fluctuates in time. If we insert a probe into the flow so that we can measure the velocity at a given point, we would see the time traces shown in the diagram. Note that we can define a time-averaged velocity: \\[ \\bar{U}(x)=\\lim _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} U(x, t) d t \\] where \\(t_0\\) is an arbitrary start sampling time and a space-averaged velocity: \\[ U_{a v}=\\frac{1}{A} \\int \\bar{U} d A=\\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-h / 2}^{+h / 2} \\bar{U} d y . \\] Reynolds decomposition The concept of a time-averaged velocity also leads to the concept of the flow being composed of a time-averaged field, and a fluctuating field. This is called the Reynolds decomposition where we write (in Cartesian coordinates, where \\(\\mathbf{V} = U\\mathbf{i}+V\\mathbf{j}+W\\mathbf{k}\\) ): \\[ \\color{purple} \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{V}(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\bar{\\mathbf{V}}(\\mathbf{x})+\\mathbf{v}&#39;(\\mathbf{x},t) \\\\ p(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\bar{p}(\\mathbf{x})+p&#39;(\\mathbf{x},t) \\end{aligned} \\] (\\(V, W\\) and the pressure \\(p\\) are decomposed similarly) The rules for averaging are: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\overline{a^{\\prime}} &amp;=0 \\\\\\overline{a+b} &amp;=\\bar{a}+\\bar{b} \\\\\\overline{\\bar{a}} &amp;=\\bar{a} \\\\\\overline{\\bar{a} \\cdot \\bar{b}} &amp;=\\bar{a} \\cdot \\bar{b} \\\\\\overline{\\left( \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial s}\\right)} &amp;=\\frac{\\partial \\bar{a}}{\\partial s}\\end{aligned}\\] IMPORTANT: \\[\\color{purple}\\overline{a \\cdot b} \\neq \\bar{a}\\bar{b}\\] This means even though the fluctuation \\(u_i&#39;\\) is zero mean i.e. \\(\\overline{u_i^{\\prime}}=0\\), it is NOT zero variance i.e. the higher motion (Reynolds stress) is non-trivial i.e. \\[\\begin{aligned}\\overline{u&#39;^2} &amp;\\neq 0 \\\\\\overline{u^{\\prime}v^{\\prime}}&amp; \\neq 0\\end{aligned}\\] Start with the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations (for incompressible flow and no body forces): \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V}&amp;=0 \\\\ \\\\ \\frac{D \\mathbf{V}}{D t}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{V}&amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p+\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{V} \\\\ or \\quad \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t}+u_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}&amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x_i}+\\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial x_j^2} \\end{aligned} \\] Plug the Reynolds decomposition of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) into Continuity and Momentum: Continuity Equation With the Reynolds decomposition, the continuity equation becomes: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial \\bar{V}}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial \\bar{W}}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v^{\\prime}}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial w^{\\prime}}{\\partial z}=0 \\] Taking the time average we obtain: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial \\bar{V}}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial \\bar{W}}{\\partial z}=0 \\] That is, \\[ \\color{purple} \\nabla \\cdot \\overline{\\mathbf{V}}=0 \\] Note that \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}=0\\) as well, denoting the mean and fluctuating velocities individually satisfy the continuity equation.

The second-order mean products of fluctuating quantities appear in the equation for the mean flow. Therefore the system of time-averaged equations describing \\(p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is NOT closed. Reynolds stress Since since the gradient of the extra terms \\(\\tau^R\\) has the dimension of a force per unit volume, it is called the Reynolds stress. It is, only apparent stress since it arises from the non-linear convective term in the Navier-Stokes equation. The second-order fluctuation terms in the Reynolds stress expression can be divided into: \\(\\overline{u_i^{\\prime 2}}\\) variance, mean square. Recall the derivation of the differential linear momentum equation, \\(\\rho\\overline{u_i^{\\prime 2}}\\) denotes the extra normal stress on unit face (\\(d_j d_k\\)) due to the turbulent motion \\(\\rho\\overline{u_i^{\\prime 2}}d_jd_k\\) additional mean \\(i\\) - momentum flux component per unit face (\\(d_j d_k\\)) specially, \\(\\sqrt{\\overline{u_i^{\\prime 2}}}\\) denotes the root mean square, is known as the intensity of the turbulence component \\(i\\), specially, \\(\\sqrt{\\overline{q^{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\overline{u^{\\prime 2}}+\\overline{v^{\\prime 2}}+\\overline{w^{\\prime 2}}}\\) denotes the intensity of the turbulence specially, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\overline{q^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho(\\overline{u^{\\prime 2}}+\\overline{v^{\\prime 2}}+\\overline{w^{\\prime 2}})\\), denotes the kinetic energy of the turbulence (per unit volume) \\(\\overline{u^\\prime_i u^\\prime_j}\\) co-variance, cross-products, single-point correlations \\(\\rho\\overline{u^\\prime_i u^\\prime_j}\\) denotes extra shear stress on unit face (\\(d_i d_k\\)) due to the turbulent motion \\(\\rho\\overline{u_i^{\\prime 2}}d_jd_k\\) denotes one of the additional mean \\(i\\) - momentum flux per unit face (\\(d_j d_k\\)) The correlation coefficient is defined as \\[ R_{i,j}=\\frac{\\overline{u^\\prime_i u^\\prime_j}}{\\sqrt{\\overline{u_i^{\\prime 2}}}\\sqrt{\\overline{u_j^{\\prime 2}}}} \\leq 1 \\] If \\(u^\\prime_i\\) and \\(u^\\prime_j\\) are independent then the correlation \\(u^\\prime_i u^\\prime_j=0\\). turbulent fluctuations also lead to extra fluxes of quantities other than momentum. For example, if there are temperature fluctuations \\(\\theta &#39;\\), then there is an extra rate of enthalpy transfer \\(\\rho C_p \\overline{θ&#39;u}\\) in the \\(x\\)-direction, etc., in addition to the enthalpy transfer by molecular conduction.Note, in addition, that whether a stress is a “normal” or a “shear” stress depends solely on the axes chosen, and, as in solids, we can always find a set of principal axes with respect to which only normal stresses remain. Since \\(q^2\\) is the trace of the Reynolds stress tensor it is invariant with rotation of axes. Sections below will not resolve the Reynolds stress, or close the system. They are just some math to understand the turbulence. Reynolds Stress Equations There is a way deriving Reynolds Stress transport functions from the N-S equation, take the Reynolds decomposed momentum equation (first equation of this section), multiply by \\(u&#39;\\) then average, instead of average directly as what we did above. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{D\\frac{1}{2}\\overline{u&#39;^2}}{Dt} &amp; = \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial t}+\\bar{U} \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial x}+\\bar{V} \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial y}+\\bar{W} \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial z}\\\\ &amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\overline{u^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}}+\\nu \\overline{u^{\\prime} \\nabla^2 u^{\\prime}}-\\left(\\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial x}+\\overline{u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime}} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial y}+\\overline{u^{\\prime} w^{\\prime}} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\\\ &amp;-\\left(\\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}}+\\overline{u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}}{\\partial y}}+\\overline{u^{\\prime} w^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}}{\\partial z}}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Similarly, multiplying the fluctuation continuity equation by \\(u&#39;^2\\), and adding the result to equation, we can change the last term and the equation is therefore: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial t}+\\bar{U} \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial x}+\\bar{V} \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial y}+\\bar{W} \\frac{\\partial \\frac{1}{2} \\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}}{\\partial z}\\\\ &amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\overline{u^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}}+\\nu \\overline{u^{\\prime} \\nabla^2 u^{\\prime}}-\\left(\\overline{u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial x}+\\overline{u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime}} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial y}+\\overline{u^{\\prime} w^{\\prime}} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\\\ &amp;-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\overline{\\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}}+\\overline{\\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime}}{\\partial y}}+\\overline{\\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}u^{\\prime} w^{\\prime}}{\\partial z}}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Besides, note the first term of \\(LHS\\), similarly, \\[ -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\overline{u^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p^{\\prime} u&#39;}}{\\partial x}+ \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\overline{p^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}}}_{\\text{cancelled out when sum}} \\] There are actual meanings for each \\(LHS\\) term:\\(\\overline{p^{\\prime} u&#39;}\\): the rate of work done by the fluid against fluctuations in pressure;\\(-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p^{\\prime} u&#39;}}{\\partial x}\\):the spatial transport of the Reynolds stress (one component of the turbulent kinetic energy) by pressure gradients (diffusion);the net loss of turbulent energy by work done in transporting fluid through regions of changing pressure;\\(\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\overline{p^{\\prime} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\prime}}{\\partial x}}\\):the transfer of turbulent energy from the \\(u\\) component to \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) components;when we write an equation for \\(q^2\\) these terms sum to zero because of continuity;the “tendency-to-isotropy” term, as this transfer of energy tends to isotropize the turbulence. For the transport equation of \\(\\overline{u&#39;v&#39;}\\), take the Reynolds decomposed momentum equation, multiply by \\(v&#39;\\) then average, we have: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{D \\overline{u v}}{D t}=&amp;-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p^{\\prime} u}}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p^{\\prime} v}}{\\partial x}\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\overline{p^{\\prime}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right)+v\\left(\\overline{u \\nabla^2 v}+\\overline{v \\nabla^2 u}\\right) \\\\ &amp;\\text{ + other terms involving second and third order correlations } \\end{aligned} \\] Note an extra 3rd order moments (triple correlations) are introduced, which need extra function to model it. And the 3rd order moments can be modelled by a introducing extra 4th order moments. The closure problem never ends. As a result, the highest-order products need to be expressed in terms of lower-order products so that the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. This is called turbulence modelling (see below), and most attention has been focussed on the turbulence kinetic energy, despite the fact that \\(q^2\\) does not appear in any of the mean momentum equations.

A simplest SPH model is implemented based on it. Introduction Related works The first open-source SPH library ever is SPHysics FORTRAN code. It is developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins University (US), the University of Vigo (Spain), the University of Manchester (UK), and the University of Rome, La Sapienza. The earliest CUDA-based SPH is GPUSPH, (GitHub gpusph)[1]. It is based on the CUDA Particles simulation template[2], the same code reviewed in the last blog. And the newest release is version 5.0. Besides, DualSPHysics, (GitHub DualSPHysics)[3], a directly inherited variation from the SPHysics. Provides similar implementations with several optimization strategies. It is called \"dual\" because it supports both CPU and GPU implementations of the core functions. Resources: SPH-Tutorial[21] by SPlisHSPlasH, SPH Learning Notes Simplifications Compared with the matured developed SPH code, see DualSPHysics User Guide[13], lots of simplifications are made in order to implement a simplest version of SPH code. Verlet Scheme There are two methods for numerical integration schemes, Verlet[6] and mainstream Symplectic[7] applied in DualSPHysics. The first is computationally simple with low stability. The second is a two-step prediction-correction method with higher stability. I choose the 1st order Euler backward and Verlet for simplification. Kernel function The performance of an SPH model depends heavily on the choice of the smoothing kernel. Instead of the Cubic Spline kernel [9] and Quintic Wendland kernel[10], the Poly6, Spicky and Viscosity kernel functions are applied followed work of Müller et. al[15]. Formulations List These are the formulation list: Neighbor list Domínguez[19] Time integration scheme: Euler backward Verlet[6] Symplectic[7] Variable time step Kernel functions: Cubic Spline kernel [9] Quintic Wendland kernel [11] Poly6, Spicky and Viscosity kernel[15] Pressure formulation (WCSPH) Ideal gas equation[16] Monaghan/Tait equation[12] Pressure Poisson equation[17] Viscosity formulation: Artificial viscosity [4] Laminar viscosity[22] Laminar viscosity[22] + SPS turbulence model[23][5] Density treatment: Delta-SPH formulation [10] Boundary condition Dynamic particles[18] Virtual particles[12] Mirroring particles[20] Update Step by Step The fundamental algorithm is very similar to the CUDA demo[2], only needs several changes for the control functions. Stage 1: Neighboring searching Theorem: Influence area The influence area illustration of SPH is shown above. The circles denoted by \\(i\\), \\(j\\) represent the target particle and the interacting particles, respectively. The target particle only interacts with particles within the circle (dashed) with a radius of \\(dist_{critic} = 2h\\). With \\(q = {dist}/{h}\\) denoting the non-dimensional distance between two particles. \\(q_{critc} = 2\\) is the non-dimensional influence radius of the target particle. The original \\(dist_{critc}\\) in the demo[2] is the sum of the radius of the two interacting particles, i.e. \\(dist_{critc} = 2 radius\\) in the case of uniform radius particles. And \\(h_{critic} = radius, q_{critic} = 1\\). There are two ways of defining \\(h\\), By \\(coefh\\) (default 1): \\[ h = coefh \\cdot \\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2+dz^2} \\cdot dp \\] \\[ h = coefh \\cdot \\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2+dz^2} dp \\] By \\(hdp\\) (default 1.5): \\[ h = hdp \\cdot dp \\] where characteristic length \\(dp\\) is choice to be the original particle distance when generating them, \\(dp = 2*radius\\) in demo[2]. There is no concept of \"particle diameter\" in SPH as in the collision model[2].In the case of particles with the same radius, for the collision model, the interaction boundary of the particles is the physical particle diameter. While in SPH, the interaction boundary is defined freely. Particles are only the discretized points in the space.The length unit \\(dp\\) is just a physical length easy to choose.In the demo[2], \\(dp\\) is equal to the diameter of particles. That means particles are generated (by function reset) tightly packed together, i.e. simple cubic stacking as shown below. The second \\(hdp\\) method is applied in the code because of its simplicity. The equivalent \\(hdp = 0.5\\) Algorithm: neighboring search In order to find the true neighboring particles, instead of brute-force searching i.e. examining distances with all of the particles in the domain, a smart way is called neighboring search. A grid as shown above is introduced, dividing the whole domain into cells. For each cell, a neighbor list containing all the particle ids in neighbor cells gets rebuilt periodically (every time step, or every 10-time step as in Hérault's work[1]). When processing a target particle, the distances only get examined with particles in the neighbor list of its located target cell. In this way, the examining times are reduced dramatically and the shared memory can be well leveraged to avoid massive global memory access (not implemented here) Grid span At a glance, in the demo[2], the grid is generated in the way that the grid spans \\(dx, dy, dz\\) equal \\(dp\\) as shown below in the code block. float cellSize = m_params.particleRadius * 2.0f; // cell size equal to particle diameter m_params.cellSize = make_float3(cellSize, cellSize, cellSize); Actually, the grid span is defined as the influencing distance \\(2h\\), as shown below. If the span is smaller, the interaction area will not be included by the neighboring area. Yet if the span is larger, the searching will not be the most efficient. Note the term \"grid\" represents 3 different concepts:equal-space structured mesh, span \\(2h\\), divides the computational domain, e.g.\"A grid is introduced, dividing the whole domain into cells\"#define GRID_SIZE 64 uint gridDim = GRID_SIZE; gridSize.x = gridSize.y = gridSize.z = gridDim; printf(&quot;grid: %d x %d x %d = %d cells\\n&quot;, gridSize.x, gridSize.y, gridSize.z, gridSize.x*gridSize.y*gridSize.z);equal-space structured mesh, span \\(dp\\), used to generate a block of particles on its lattices, e.g.ParticleSystem::resetfloat jitter = m_params.particleRadius*0.01f; uint s = (int) ceilf(floor(powf((float) m_numParticles, 1.0f / 3.0f)*1000)/1000); uint gridSize[3]; gridSize[0] = gridSize[1] = gridSize[2] = s; initGrid(gridSize, m_params.particleRadius*2.0f, jitter, m_numParticles);The GPU grid containing blocks of blockSize when running on the device e.g. in the code:// compute grid and thread block size for a given number of elements void computeGridSize(uint n, uint blockSize, uint &amp;numBlocks, uint &amp;numThreads) &#123; numThreads = min(blockSize, n); numBlocks = iDivUp(n, numThreads); &#125; void collide() &#123; // thread per particle uint numThreads, numBlocks; computeGridSize(numParticles, 64, numBlocks, numThreads); // execute the kernel collideD&lt;&lt;&lt; numBlocks, numThreads &gt;&gt;&gt;(); &#125;In demo[2], when particle numbers are \\(64\\times64\\times64 = 262144\\), the first two grids coincide with each other. And \\(262144\\) is the maximum particle number according to the domain. And numBlocks = 4096. Wait, there is another tiny difference (It turns out that we are lucky to be able to leave it but it is important to know this).There are two ways of Building the Grid. One simple approach is via Atomic Operations, which is well illustrated by demo[2]. In this approach, we allocate two arrays to the global memory:gridCounters – this stores the number of particles in each cell so far. It is initialized to zero at the start of each frame.gridCells – this stores the particle indices for each cell, and has room for a fixed maximum number of particles per cell.Why fixed maximum number of particles per cell? It is because it is inefficient (nearly impossible) for GPU to allocate memories dynamically, which means the maximum number of particles per grid cell must be pre-defined.In the scenario of demo[2], this maximum number is easy to choose as the distance between particles is limited. Because particles in the collision model are rigid bodies and overlapping is not allowed, the maximum is set to be 4 particles per grid cell in the demo[2], taking the assumption of simple cubic stacking. But in SPH, there is no such limitation as discussed above. We must make careful assumptions about it when we use the Atomic Operations method to build the grid.Luckily, we are using the second approach, via sorting, slightly difficult to understand, also well illustrated in the demo[2], and no need for the limitation of the maximum particles per cell.Yet in Hérault's work[1], the maximum lenth of the neighboring list is pre-defined, so that the examining loop is further unrolled during compilation for efficiency. We are not going to do that at the first time although is it easy to apply. code original The distance examination is applied in __device__ float3 collideSpheres as: __device__ float3 collideSpheres(float3 posA, float3 posB, float3 velA, float3 velB, float radiusA, float radiusB, float attraction) &#123; // calculate relative position float3 relPos = posB - posA; float dist = length(relPos); float collideDist = radiusA + radiusB; float3 force = make_float3(0.0f); if (dist &lt; collideDist) &#123; // force += ... &#125; return force; &#125; The radius of two particles are set to be different, not suitable for SPH model. update step 0: house keeping comment out collider for simplicity and any function related to it such as: M_MOVE mode and its controller. step 1: parameters/arguments, functions renaming, switching and introducing Rename the functions and params from collision related to SPH related such as: collideSpheres() -&gt; SPHParticles() collideDist -&gt; interactDist Introduce dp into params (i.e. struct SimParams), change grid span for generating the particles from particle diameter to dp, change the domain grid span to 2*h Introduce hdp,h into params, set hdp=0.5 and h=hdp*dp Make dp and hdp modifiable by flag via getCmdLineArgumentFloat step 2: In function SPHParticles, change the distance limitation interactDist to 2*h so that distance limitation same as before. The original __device__ float3 collideSpheres is changed to be: __device__ float3 SPHParticles(float3 posA, float3 posB, float3 velA, float3 velB, float h, float attraction) &#123; // calculate relative position float3 relPos = posB - posA; float dist = length(relPos); float interactDist = 2*h; float3 force = make_float3(0.0f); if (dist &lt; interactDist) &#123; // force += ... &#125; return force; &#125; minor cleanups The boundary condition is parameterized for different setting of gridsize other than 64. A new parameter worldMaxPos is introduced right after the worldOrigin parameter as: if (pos.x &gt; params.worldMaxPos.x - params.dp*0.5) &#123; pos.x = params.worldMaxPos.x - params.dp*0.5; vel.x *= params.boundaryDamping; &#125; Add more flags operations such as gridLength Another key factor introduced for dump all the parameters as: case &#x27;k&#x27;: psystem-&gt;dumpParameters(); break; Results of different hdps ./particles hdp=0.5 ./particles hdp=0.8 Stage 2: Verlet time scheme Theorem Instead of the simple Euler backward time discretization scheme originally applied in the integration step, the Verlet scheme [6] is used such that: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{v}_a^{n+1}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{v}_a^{n-1}+2 \\Delta t \\boldsymbol{F}_a^n \\\\ \\boldsymbol{r}_a^{n+1}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{r}_a^n+\\Delta t \\boldsymbol{V}_a^n+0.5 \\Delta t^2 \\boldsymbol{F}_a^n \\end{aligned} \\] For every \\(N_s\\) time steps: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{v}_a^{n+1}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{v}_a^n+\\Delta t \\boldsymbol{F}_a^n \\\\ \\boldsymbol{r}_a^{n+1}&amp;=\\boldsymbol{r}_a^n+\\Delta t \\boldsymbol{V}_a^n+0.5 \\Delta t^2 \\boldsymbol{F}_a^n \\end{aligned} \\] Code original The DEM is implemented in two steps, i.e. two locations: struct integrate_functor related params: gravity, globalDamping, boundaryDamping. float3 SPHParticles() related params: spring, damping, shear. The work flow in this stage is such that: update step 0: debug, the velocity update formula In original SPHD function, the new velocity is updated such that: newVel[originalIndex] = make_float4(vel + force, 0.0f); the velocity is added with the force without a multiplying of the delta time. Provide the SPHD with extra argument deltatime (changing SPH as well) and change the original code as: newVel[originalIndex] = make_float4(vel + deltaTime*force, 0.0f); step 1: Rearrange integrate_functor and SPHD. Moving force out as a global parameter. In SPHD, the gravity (original in integrate_functor) and the collision forces (spring, damping, shear and attraction) are added to one argument force. Delete the argument newVel in SPHD and SPH. Add the argument newForce and update the force with gravity, the code structure as newVel: newForce[originalIndex]= make_float4(force, 0.0f); integrate_functor takes the argument force from SPHD and update the vel and pos as before (1st order Euler backword scheme). Delete the force of globalDamping. Note that In the original code, force is treated as temporal parameter, no memory of force needed. step 2: rename the integrate_functor as integrate_verlet and update the vel and pos via the Verlet scheme integrate_verlet takes the pointer of step, vel_1 and vel_2 from outside, change these augments inside, mimicking the vel. vel_1 and vel_2 indicates the velocity fields from last, and last of last step, respectively step 3: debug, \"nan\" exists when updating the particles Inspect force, vel and pos of particles in dumpparticles found that the force returns \"nan\" because of the distance of two particles being 0. Add minimum distance condition to the updating force process in SPHParticles as: if (dist &lt; interactDist &amp;&amp; relPos.x &gt; 1e-10 &amp;&amp; relPos.y &gt; 1e-10 &amp;&amp; relPos.z &gt; 1e-10 &amp;&amp; relPos.x &lt; -1e-10 &amp;&amp; relPos.y &lt; -1e-10 &amp;&amp; relPos.z &lt; -1e-10) step 4: make deltaTime (0.04) and renderStep (10) as variables, changeable without recompilation. Print those information before rendering. Result of Verlet time scheme The nearly second order Verlet time scheme requires a much lower \\(\\Delta t\\), for real time simulation, one-step-render-one-step-update is not applicable. Stage 3: Control function Theorem: SPH system Instead of the DEM method that has been used for collision model, the control function between particles are changed, inspired by this notebook and work by Muller et. al[15] Density (Derived continuity equation): \\[ \\rho(\\boldsymbol{r_i}) = \\sum_j m_j W_{poly6}(\\boldsymbol{r_i} - \\boldsymbol{r_j},h), \\quad i\\ne j \\] where the the mass of all particles \\(m =\\rho_0\\frac{4}{3}\\pi*\\left(\\frac{dp}{2}\\right)^3,dp=\\frac{2}{64}.\\) Weakly-compressible assumption is adopted, so the mass of each particle is fixed and the density varies. Pressure (state equation): Based on the state of equation by Desbrun[16] \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;P=k(\\rho - \\rho_0),\\ \\end{aligned} \\] where the rest density \\(\\rho_0=1000, k=3\\). Force (momentum equation): Pressure force, gravity force and viscosity force is considered as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d \\boldsymbol{v_i}}{d t}&amp;=-\\sum_j\\frac{1}{\\rho_i}\\nabla P_{j}+\\boldsymbol{g}+\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma} \\\\ &amp;= -\\sum_j \\left( m_j\\frac{P_i+P_j}{2\\rho_i\\rho_j}\\right)\\nabla W_{spiky}(\\boldsymbol{r_i} - \\boldsymbol{r_j},h) + \\boldsymbol{g}+\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}, \\quad i \\ne j \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] where the gravity force \\(\\boldsymbol{g} = (0, -1.0, 0) m/s^2\\). \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\\) is the dissipation terms, here, we only consider the linear viscosity[22], i.e. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}&amp;=\\mu\\sum_jm_j\\frac{\\boldsymbol{v_j} - \\boldsymbol{v_i}}{\\rho_i \\rho_j}\\nabla^2 W_{viscosity}(\\boldsymbol{r_i} - \\boldsymbol{r_j},h),\\quad i\\ne j \\end{aligned} \\] where the viscosity of the fluid \\(\\mu = 5.0\\) Kernel function \\(W(\\boldsymbol{r}, h)\\) denotes the kernel function, we choose three different kernels. In 3D dimensions, they are defined as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;W_{poly6}(\\boldsymbol{r}, h)=\\frac{315}{64\\pi h^9}\\left(h^2-r^2\\right)^3, \\quad 0 \\leq r \\leq h \\\\ &amp;W_{spiky}(\\boldsymbol{r}, h)=\\frac{15}{\\pi h^6}\\left(h-r\\right)^3, \\quad 0 \\leq r \\leq h \\\\ &amp;\\nabla W_{spiky}(\\boldsymbol{r}, h)=-\\frac{45}{\\pi h^6}\\left(h-r\\right)^2\\frac{\\boldsymbol{r}}{r}, \\quad 0 \\leq r \\leq h \\\\ &amp;W_{viscosity}(\\boldsymbol{r}, h)=\\frac{15}{2\\pi h^3}\\left(-\\frac{r^3}{2h^3}+\\frac{r^2}{h^2}+\\frac{h}{2r}-1\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq r \\leq h \\\\ &amp;\\nabla^2W_{viscosity}(\\boldsymbol{r}, h)=\\frac{45}{\\pi h^6}\\left(h-r\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq r \\leq h \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Code original The collision force is calculated from the particle positions, plus some constants. Refer to the work flow in stage 2. update step 1: add more parameters define more vector parameters to particleSystem float density float pressure add more scalar parameters to particleSystem.params mass, rho0, k step 2: Add new file particles_kernel_functions.cuhto directory src, containing the Poly6, gradient of Spiky and Laplacian of Viscosity kernel functions __device__ float poly6Kernel(float3 posA, float3 posB, float h) //3-D &#123; float3 relPos = posB - posA; float dist = length(relPos); h = 2*h; float wker = 315.0f / 64.0f / PI / pow(h, 9) * pow(h*h-dist*dist,3); return wker; &#125; step 3: update density then pressure by function SPHDensityPressure // accumulation density with another __device__ float SPHDensityParticles(float3 posA, float3 posB, float h, float mass) &#123; // calculate relative position float3 relPos = posB - posA; float dist = length(relPos); float interactDist = 2*h; float density = 0.0f; // float maxDist = params.dp /100.0f; if (dist &lt; interactDist) &#123; // density density = mass*poly6Kernel(posA, posB, h); &#125; return density; &#125; step 4: update force by function SPHForce, passing the resultant force to integrate_verlet The final work flow in this stage is such that: result problem that still exist boundary problem To manifest better the problem, take a detail look at the numParticles = 80000 example, angle 1 angle 2 angle 3 A bunch of dense particles lay on the boundary resulting a huge density/pressure region, pushing the particles away from it, leaving a unphysical gap. Need a modification to the boundary. Stage 4: Boundary In former granular collision model[2], the boundary condition can be provided precisely as the radius of the particle is physical. To achieve the force of boundary to particles, following the work of Crespo at.al[18], we arrange a layer of static particles regularly spanned on the boundary with same distance coefDp*dp. The density and pressure of the boundary particles is changed with the iteration, while the velocity and position of them remains the same. code update Modify the arrangement of particles in initGrid. At first, arrange the bottom particles for (uint z = 0; z &lt; m_params.numNb + 1; z++) &#123; for (uint x = 0; x &lt; m_params.numNb + 1; x++) &#123; uint j = (z * (m_params.numNb + 1)) + x; m_hPos[j * 4] = (m_params.dp * m_params.coefDp * x) + m_params.worldOrigin.x; m_hPos[j * 4 + 1] = m_params.worldOrigin.y; m_hPos[j * 4 + 2] = (m_params.dp * m_params.coefDp * z) + m_params.worldOrigin.z; m_hPos[j * 4 + 3] = -1.0f; &#125; &#125; Then the other boundary particles arrange like this. To improve the efficiency on boundary top, we don't arrange particles there and the we arrange particles on surrounding faces with a certain height coefBh * (woldMaxPos.y - worldOriginPos.y) . result After validation, the particle system works better when the distance of boundary particles is 0.6dp. Choose coefBh as 2/3. Stage 5: Multiple GPU Problems The CUDA environment does not support, natively, a cooperative multi-GPU model. The model is based more on a single-core, single-GPU relationship. This works really well for tasks that are independent of one another, but is rather a pain if you wish to write a task that needs to have the GPUs cooperate in some way.

Main referencesParticle Simulation using CUDA - NVIDIAChapter 29. Real-Time Rigid Body Simulation on GPUs[1] This is a Real-Time Particle Simulation implemented in CUDA. Discrete element method(DEM)[2] is implemented with uniform grid data structure. Real-time granular materials rendering is applied by openGL. This framework can be extended to more complicated problems and methods such as SPH[3][4] model for fluid. The uniform grid[5] technique could be extended to more sophisticated structures such as hierarchical grids.

Note that only rendering mode branch is presented i.e. !BenchMark == true. The conditioning statements are colored with navy blue. And the functions needed for attention are colored with dark red. class: particleSystem This is the main class for particles, including set particle position, updating... The DEM[3] method is implemented in the collideSpheres function. Update particles There are three main steps to perform the updating: Integration, Building the grid data structure and Processing collisions, which are illustrated in Particle Simulation using CUDA - NVIDIA. Note for the grid data structure, sorting is used instead of the atomic operations. Extensions After understanding the code structure, there is no reason for not adding some new features: Active gravity mode One of benefits of the real-time rendering is the ability of interaction. In active gravity mode, the gravity rotates at the opposite direction against the camera, as shown below. Code step 1: setGravity3d original In original code, the gravity direction is fixed (norm: \\([0,-1,0]\\)), the global variable gravity is defined as scalar (float): float gravity = 0.0003f; the function to set gravity is defined in class ParticleSystem as: void setGravity(float x) &#123; m_params.gravity = make_float3(0.0f, x, 0.0f); &#125; when use it: psystem-&gt;setGravity(-gravity) update The good news is that the class variable gravity is defined as float3. we only need to upgraded the class function to be void setGravity3d(float x, float y, float z) &#123; m_params.gravity = make_float3(x, y, z); &#125; and the global variable and its usage: float gravity3d[] = &#123;0, -0.001, 0&#125;; psystem-&gt;setGravity3d(gravity3d[0], gravity3d[1], gravity3d[2]); step 2: rotateGravity original Recall the Code Structure, the camera rotation is applied in glutDisplayFunc(display). The code (in function display()) is such as: for (int c = 0; c &lt; 3; ++c) &#123; camera_trans_lag[c] += (camera_trans[c] - camera_trans_lag[c]) * inertia; camera_rot_lag[c] += (camera_rot[c] - camera_rot_lag[c]) * inertia; &#125; glTranslatef(camera_trans_lag[0], camera_trans_lag[1], camera_trans_lag[2]); glRotatef(camera_rot_lag[0], 1.0, 0.0, 0.0); glRotatef(camera_rot_lag[1], 0.0, 1.0, 0.0); The camera rotation is applied by glRotatef(camera_rot_lag[0, 1]), where the camera normal vector is rotated from \\([0,1,0]\\) every time step. update Define new global variables gravity3dOrg and rotateGravity float gravity3dOrg[] = &#123;0, -0.001, 0&#125;; bool rotateGravity = false; Add code to the display(), after the sampled original code above as if (rotateGravity) &#123; // rotate gravity if camera rotate float angleX = -M_PI*camera_rot_lag[0]/180.0; float angleY = -M_PI*camera_rot_lag[1]/180.0; float temp[3] = &#123;0,0,0&#125;; rotateVectorX(gravityOrg, temp, angleX); gravity3d[1] = 0.0; rotateVectorY(temp, gravity3d, angleY); // // test code: print point data // printf(&quot;%.2f %.2f\\t&quot;,camera_rot_lag[0], camera_rot_lag[1]); // for (int i=0; i&lt;3; i++) // &#123; // printf(&quot;%.2f &quot;,1000*gravity3d[i]); // &#125; // printf(&quot;\\t%.2f\\n&quot;,1000*sqrt(gravity3d[0]*gravity3d[0]+gravity3d[1]*gravity3d[1]+gravity3d[2]*gravity3d[2])); &#125; Define functions rotateVectorX and rotateVectorY in a new file vectorRotate.hpp #include &lt;math.h&gt; //function to calculate rotate vectors template &lt;class T2&gt; void rotateVectorX(T2 *vector_a, T2 *vector_rotated, T2 &amp;angle) &#123; vector_rotated[1] = vector_a[1] * cos(angle); vector_rotated[2] = vector_a[1] * sin(angle); &#125; template &lt;class T2&gt; void rotateVectorY(T2 *vector_a, T2 *vector_rotated, T2 &amp;angle) &#123; vector_rotated[0] = vector_a[2] * sin(angle); vector_rotated[1] = vector_a[1]; vector_rotated[2] = vector_a[2] * cos(angle); &#125; step3: toggle rotateGravity Switches can be toggled by keyboard in glutKeyboardFunc(key). Add another case in key() as: case &#x27;w&#x27;: wireframe = !wireframe; break; case &#x27;h&#x27;: displaySliders = !displaySliders; break; // new added case &#x27;f&#x27;: rotateGravity = !rotateGravity; break; In order to add this option to the right button menu, go to initMenus() and add afterwards: glutAddMenuEntry(&quot;Toggle sliders [h]&quot;, &#x27;h&#x27;); glutAddMenuEntry(&quot;Toggle active gravity (f)&quot;, &#x27;f&#x27;); glutAttachMenu(GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON); Algorithm The only algorithm related is vector rotation. Mimicking the glRotatef, two-step algorithm is adopted. step 1: rotate original gravity \\([0,-0.001,0]\\) around the 1st dimension (\\(x\\) axis) by \\(angleX\\) step 2: then rotate resulting gravity vector toward 2st dimension (\\(y\\) axis) by \\(angleY\\) step 1 Recall the vector rotation matrix, see: wikipedia on rotation matrices With vector \\(V_1(x_1,y_1,z_1)\\) rotates by angle \\(\\beta\\), the resulting vector \\(V_2(x_2,y_2,z_2)\\): \\[ V_2 = \\mathbf{R} V_1 \\] when the rotation axis is \\(x\\), as in step 1, the rotation matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{R_x} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp;\\cos\\beta &amp; -\\sin\\beta \\\\ 0 &amp;\\sin\\beta &amp; \\cos\\beta \\end{array} } \\right] \\] that is to say: \\[ \\begin{aligned} x_2 &amp;= x_1 \\\\ y_2 &amp;= \\cos\\beta y_1 - \\sin\\beta z_1 \\\\ z_2 &amp;= \\sin\\beta y_1 + \\cos\\beta z_1 \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] the code is: vector_rotated[0] = vector_a[0]; vector_rotated[1] = vector_a[1] * cos(angle) - vector_a[2] * sin(angle); vector_rotated[2] = vector_a[1] * sin(angle) + vector_a[2] * cos(angle); In this case, \\(V_1\\) aligns to the negative y axis i.e. vector_a[0] = vector_a[2] = 0. So the code is simplified as shown above. step 2 the rotation matrix around \\(y\\) axis is: \\[ \\mathbf{R_{y}}= \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\beta &amp; 0 &amp; \\sin\\beta\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -\\sin\\beta &amp; 0 &amp; \\cos\\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\] in code that is: vector_rotated[0] = vector_a[0] * cos(angle) + vector_a[2] * sin(angle); vector_rotated[1] = vector_a[1]; vector_rotated[2] = -vector_a[0] * sin(angle) + vector_a[2] * cos(angle); in this case, vector_a[0] = 0, the code is thus simplified Periodic bottom boundary Instead pf Dirichlet boundary condition on wall, it possible to impose another type of boundary condition. In this example, when the particle y position exceeds the bottom, the position will reset to the top, and the velocity remains. code step 1: periodic boundary original Recall the Code Structure, the boundary condition is applied in integrate_functor. The bottom boundary is defined as rigid: if (pos.y &lt; -1.0f + params.particleRadius) &#123; pos.y = -1.0f + params.particleRadius; vel.y *= params.boundaryDamping; &#125; update Define a extra conditional statement using a new parameter if (params.rigidBottom) &#123; // origial rigid boundary if (pos.y &lt; -1.0f + params.particleRadius) &#123; pos.y = -1.0f + params.particleRadius; vel.y *= params.boundaryDamping; &#125; &#125; else &#123; // periodic boundary if (pos.y &lt; -1.0f + params.particleRadius) &#123; pos.y = 1.0f - params.particleRadius; &#125; &#125; params.rigidBottom should to be add the the parameter list. step 2: parameters original params is the type of SimParams defined in particles_kernel.cuh // simulation parameters struct SimParams &#123; float3 colliderPos; float colliderRadius; float3 gravity; //... &#125;; SimParams m_params is a parameter of class ParticleSystem. It is initialized in constructor ParticleSystem::ParticleSystem such as: ParticleSystem::ParticleSystem(uint numParticles, uint3 gridSize, bool bUseOpenGL): m_bUseOpenGL(bUseOpenGL), m_numParticles(numParticles), // ... m_gridSize(gridSize), &#123; // ... // set simulation parameters m_params.gridSize = m_gridSize; //... &#125; update Mimicking the gridSize parameter, add new global parameter bool rigidBottom = true; in particles.cpp define new member parameter bool m_rigidBottom in class ParticleSystem add new input parameter and initialization list of constructor function as ParticleSystem::ParticleSystem(uint numParticles, uint3 gridSize, bool bUseOpenGL, bool rigidBottom) : //... m_rigidBottom(rigidBottom), m_gridSize(gridSize), //... &#123; //... // set simulation parameters m_params.rigidBottom = m_rigidBottom; m_params.gridSize = m_gridSize; //... &#125; There is another way to change parameters, suitable for non-constant parameters.For example define a function and call it every step in display like:void setGravity3d(float x, float y, float z) &#123; m_params.gravity = make_float3(x, y, z); &#125;void display() &#123; if (!bPause) &#123; psystem-&gt;setIterations(iterations); psystem-&gt;setDamping(damping); psystem-&gt;setGravity3d(gravity3d[0], gravity3d[1], gravity3d[2]); psystem-&gt;setCollideSpring(collideSpring); //... &#125; //... &#125; Directory house keeping This is only a update to the directory tree for clearer developing afterwards.

The cost by data transfer might be bigger than the multiple computational cost on GPU. Directly transfer CPU code to GPU might not get a higher performance, if the data transfer is not optimised. Transfering bigger data is better than smaller data. If the data &lt; 80KB, the latency dominants the performance. data transfer at the same time with the computation double buffering, one for the data transfer and the other for the computation The term double buffering is used for copying data between two buffers for direct memory access (DMA) transfers, not for enhancing performance, but to meet specific addressing requirements of a device. Memory Coalescing (most important) global memory Although the bandwidth of the global memory is big, the latency is as high as 400-800 cycles. Load and store multiple times can be very time consuming and inefficient. L1 and L2 Cache L1 cache is 128-bytes aligned Multiples of 128B are read L2 cache is 32-bytes aligned Multiples of 32-bytes are read Memory Coalescing (caching or non-caching) Global Memory -&gt; caching For Fermi, Global Memory -&gt; L1 cache allowed (default) It can be changed into Global Memory -&gt; L2 cache by adding flags wen compiling, as nvcc -Xptxas -dlem=cg For Kepler and newer, L1 is reserved for Local Memory Only Global Memory -&gt; L2 caching conditions When a warp requests 32 aligned, 4-byte words, there are several conditions: warp word requested threads word requested caching cache-lines data move across the bus Bus utilization 32 aligned, 4-byte 32 threads requesting 1 float each (continuous in memory) L1 1 128 bytes 100% 32 aligned, 4-byte 32 threads requesting 1 float each (not sequentially indexed) L1 1 128 bytes 100% 32 aligned, 4-byte 32 threads requesting 1 float each (not all continuous in memory) L1 2 256 bytes 50% 32 aligned, 4-byte 32 threads requesting 1 float each (not all continuous in memory) L2 5 160 bytes 80% 1 4-byte ALL 32 threads requesting 1 float value L1 1 128 bytes 3.125% 1 4-byte ALL 32 threads requesting 1 float value L2 1 32 bytes 12.5% 32 scattered 4-byte 32 threads requesting 1 float each (randomly) L1 N N * 128 bytes 128 / (N * 128) 32 scattered 4-byte 32 threads requesting 1 float each (randomly) L2 N N * 32 bytes 128 / (N * 32) principle requesting large, consecutive locations instead of random locations Memory coalescing – rearrange access patterns to improve performance Useful today but will be less useful with large on-chip caches The GPU coalesces consecutive reads in a full-warp into a single read example When accessing matrix data, avoid single thread requesting consecutive locations. Share memory What if it is impossible to request memory concecutively? It happens especially for the high dimensional conditions. Strategy: load global memory in a coalesce-able fashion into shared memory Then access shared memory randomly at maximum bandwidth Much lower latency then global memory. Reduce the access of global memory Inter-thread communication within a block Bank Conflicts When called a parallel data cache, multiple threads can access shared memory at the same time. Share memory is divided into 32 32-bit banks banks Can be accessed simultaneously Requests to the same bank are serialized Banks Each bank can service one address per two cycles Per-bank bandwidth: 32-bits per two cycles Successive 32-bit words are assigned to successive banks example __shared__ float tile[64]; Bank Conflict Two simultaneous accesses to the same bank, but not the same address, The memory accessing will be run serialized G80-GT200: 16 banks, with 8 SPs concurrently executing Fermi &amp; Newer: 32 banks, with 16 SPs concurrently executing conditions The latency of share memory is comparable with the registers, when no bank conflicts. The conflicts can be detected by warp_serialize profiler. examples Access to different banks by a warp executes in parallel. __shared__ float tile[64]; int tidx = threadidx.x; float foo = tile[tidx] - 3; Access to same element of bank by a warp executes in parallel. __shared__ float tile[64]; int tidx = threadidx.x; int bar = tile[tidx - tidx % 2]; Access to defferent element of bank by a warp executes in serial 2-way conflict __shared__ float tile[64]; int tidx = threadidx.x; int bar = tile[tidx + tidx % 2 * 31]; Fermi vs Kepler &amp; Newer Fermi (Compute 2.x) Bank width: 32-bits for 2 clock cycles Kepler (Compute &gt;= 3.x)and newer Bank width: 64-bits per 1 clock cycle Also 2 modes - either successive 32-bit words (in 32-bit mode) or successive 64-bit words (64-bit mode) are assigned to successive banks. So bank conflicts can still occur. Note: (*) However, devices of compute capability 3.x typically have lower clock frequencies than devices of compute capability 2.x for improved power efficiency Example Matrix Transpose Inherently parallel - Each element independent of another Simple to implement CPU for(int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++) &#123; for(int j = 0; j &lt; cols; j++) &#123; transpose[i][j] = matrix[j][i] &#125; &#125; O(n2 ) slow GPU V1 __global__ void matrixTranspose(float *_A, float *_A_t) &#123; int row = blockDim.y*blockIdx.y+threadIdx.y; int col = blockDim.x*blockIdx.x+threadIdx.x; _A_t[row*sizeX+col] = _A[col*sizeY+row]; &#125; O(1) - Launch 1 thread per element Essentially one memcpy from global-to-global should be fast YET: Problem Memory coalescing, recall the matrix accessing example, when row-major: consecutive locations when loading yet scattered locations on writing when col-major: consecutive locations when writing yet scattered locations on loading Improvement Recall the share memory, we can make both the global memory &lt;--&gt; share memory coalesced in both directions.

Associative example: a * b, a + b, a &amp; b, a | b non associative: a / b, a - b GPU V1: Interleaved Addressing Parallel binary reduce is applied to a part of the whole array in each block. Multiple blocks help in: Maximizing Occupancy by keeping SMs busy Processing very large arrays. Parallel reduce is not arithmetic intensive, it takes only 1 Flop per thread(1 add) so it is completely memory bandwidth bounded. Need a way to communicate partial results between blocks Global sync is not practical due to the overhead of sync across so many cores Solution: Call the reduce kernel recursively to reduce the results from previous reduce \\(\\log_2(n)\\) passes for n elements \\(O(\\log_2n)\\) complexity code Declare dynamic shared memory and compute index Load input into shared memory Reduce in shared memory Copy result of each block into global memory We only modify Parts 2 and 3 for optimization __global__ void reduce_v1(const float* d_idata, float* d_odata, int n) &#123; // step 1 // Dynamic allocation of shared memory - See kernel call in host code extern __shared__ float smem[]; int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; // Calculate 1D Index // step 2 if(idx &lt; n) &#123; smem[threadIdx.x] = d_idata[idx]; // Copy input data to shared memory &#125; __syncthreads(); // step 3 // Reduce within block // Start from c = 1, up to block size, each time doubling the offset for(int c = 1; c &lt; blockDim.x; c *= 2) &#123; if (threadIdx.x % (2 * c) == 0)// Add only on left index of each level &#123; smem[threadIdx.x] += smem[threadIdx.x + c]; &#125; __syncthreads(); &#125; // step 4 // Copy result of reduction to global memory if(threadIdx.x == 0) &#123; d_odata[blockIdx.x] = smem[0]; &#125; &#125; 1st pass: threadid.x = 0, 2, 4, 6 ... are working while the others keep idle. 2st pass: threadid.x = 0, 4 ... are working while the others keep idle. 3st pass: threadid.x = 0 ... are working while the others keep idal. At each pass, number of threads required is halved. The idle threads doubled. note that the as stride increases, the not-working threads do the same work with the working threads. Because threads in the same warp need to run exact the same computations. Yet no registered are allocated to them. problems: Interleaved addressing Too many divergent branches Improvement Avoiding using modulo operator % Non-divergent branches Warp revision A thread block is broken down to 32-thread warps, warps are executed physically in a SM(X) Total number of warps in a block: ceil(T/Wsize) Each thread in a warp execute one common instruction at a time Warps with diverging threads execute each branch serially Warp Partitioning Definitions Warp Partitioning: how threads from a block are divided into warps - based on consecutive increasing threadIdx. Knowledge of warp partitioning can be used to: Minimize divergent branches Retire warps early Recall the divergent branches inside one warp: the performance can be largely deterited. examples For warpSize = 32, the code below will cause divergence inside a warp. if (threadIdx.x &gt; 15) &#123; // ... &#125; the code below suffers no from the branch divergence if (threadIdx.x &gt; warpSize - 1) &#123; // ... &#125; because the divergence happens across the warps. Rule Make threads per blocks to be a multiple of a warp (32) Incomplete warps waste unused cores 256 threads per blocks is a good starting point Try to have all threads in warp execute in lock step Divergent warps will use time to compute all paths as if they were in serial order GPU V2: Removing divergence branching Revise the problems existing Interleaved addressing Too many divergent branches Now we are dealing with the second one. __global__ void reduce_v2(const float* d_idata, float* d_odata, int n) &#123; // step 1 and 2 ... // step 3 for(int c = 1; c &lt; blockDim.x; c *= 2) &#123; int index = threadIdx.x * 2 * c; if (index &lt; blockDim.x) // No divergence except last warp &#123; smem[index] += smem[index + c]; &#125; __syncthreads(); &#125; // step 4 ... &#125; Simple modification but Need to change the for-loop structure Need the same values, just not the modulo etc Restructure GPU V3: Sequential Addressing Now we are dealing with the first problem. __global__ void reduce_v2(const float* d_idata, float* d_odata, int n) &#123; // step 1 and 2 ... // step 3 // Reduce within block for(int c = blockDim.x / 2; c &gt; 0; c &gt;&gt;= 1) &#123; // No need for index or modulo.

At each pass, number of threads required is halved. The idle threads are able to release because the indexes of the working threads are changed. Compared with V1/2: Suppose the warpSize = 2 Given the knowledge of warp partitioning Pass number Original Optimised 1st pass 4 divergences, 0 warp can be retired 0 divergence, 2 warps can be retired 2st pass 2 divergences, 2 warp can be retired 0 divergences, 3 warps can be retired 3st pass 1 divergence, 3 warps can be retired 1 divergence, 3 warps can be retired Problem Always think of: Last warp divergence? Memory Coalescing? Bank conflicts? How is thread usage? Imporvements How to reduce the idel warps? Launch only half the threads per block reduce the threads load in step 2 Get’s rid of maximum wastage How to load data into shared memory? adding on Load GPU V4.1: Single add on load Each thread reads multiple values into shared memory. So why not add on load too? Doesn’t increase our global memory usage Also reduces the amount of shared memory we need Or keep shared memory same and do more work per block __global__ void reduce_v1(const float* d_idata, float* d_odata, int n) &#123; // step 1 // step 2 if(idx &lt; n) &#123; smem[threadIdx.x] = d_idata[idx]; //Copy and add block data into shared memory if(idx + blockDim.x &lt; n) &#123; smem[threadIdx.x] += d_idata[idx + blockDim.x]; &#125; &#125; __syncthreads(); // step 3 // step 4 &#125; Problem Single - the threads needed is halved only in the first pass Improvement Multiple adds per thread on load Replace single add with a loop. Use a counter TILE to define the number to adds per thread defining TILE as global constant will allow loop unrolling preferable set TILE as power of 2 GPU V4.2: Multiple adds on load __global__ void reduce_v1(const float* d_idata, float* d_odata, int n) &#123; // step 1 // step 2 if(idx &lt; n) &#123; smem[threadIdx.x] = 0; // Start with identity for(int c = 0; c &lt; TILE; c++) &#123; // Copy and add block data with block offset into shared memory if(idx + c * blockDim.x &lt; n) &#123; smem[threadIdx.x] += d_idata[idx + c * blockDim.x]; &#125; &#125; &#125; __syncthreads(); // step 3 // step 4 &#125; problem Last warp is still divergent solution Unroll the last warp GPU V5.1: Last warp unroll Split the step 3 into 2 steps: __global__ void reduce_v2(const float* d_idata, float* d_odata, int n) &#123; // step 1 and 2 ... // step 3 // step 3A for(int c = blockDim.x / 2; c &gt; 32; c &gt;&gt;= 1) &#123; // No need for index or modulo.

The cost is nothing – We are executing threads that were sitting idle before. Improvement Able to unroll compeletely? GPU V5.2: Complete unroll Taking inspiration from Stage 4, unroll the for loop entirely in step 3A #pragma unroll requires sizes to be known at compile time Use Templates CUDA supports C++ template parameters on device and host functions Specify block size as a function template parameter: reduce_v5&lt;threads&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;dims.dimBlocks, dims.dimThreads, sizeof(float) * dims.dimThreads &gt;&gt;&gt; (d_idata, d_odata, n_elements); Block size in GPU limited to 512 or 1024 threads.

Threads Synchronizition Recall Thread hierarchy Recall CUDA memory hierarchy in GPU, the thread can be index with blockId and threadId: (1D indexing for example) int threadID = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; float x = input[threadID]; float y = func(x); output[threadID] = y; Synchronizing threads Threads in the same block (not gird) can be synchronized with function __syncthreads(), this function create a barrier: Mds[i] = Md[j]; __syncthreads(); func(Mds[i], Mds[i+1]); need similar execution time for each thread block synchronize is a compromise because global synchronization costs too much. Problem of synchronizing synchronizing actually breaks the parallelization, and more severely, it can leads to thread deadlock, such as below: if (someFunc()) &#123; __syncthreads(); &#125; else: &#123; __syncthreads(); &#125; no syncthreads in branches ! Scheduling model Example Take a old G80 as an example: 16 SMs, 8 SPs per SM 128 SPs in total up to768 treads on a SM, not all been executed 12288 threads in total, (on 16 SMs) Warp Warp is a logical concept, it represents a goup of threads in a block. threadIndxs are concecutive. if there are 64 threads run on the same block, a warp has 32 threads. So it has 2 warps, the threadIndx are [0-31],[32-63]. Basic unit of thread scheduling Run on the same SM (block) Ant any time, only one of the warps is executed by SM. The threads in the same warp are sychronized in nuture, the instruction is the same as well. The not-running warps are saved in the context memory The warps whose next instruction hasits operands ready for consumptiona are sligible for execution. They can be switched (schedualed) as a click, with no overhead in order to hide latency. Branches Recall the branch divergence, it is also called warp divergence In extreme, the performance will drop drastically, yet is has been highly optimised. And it is unessasary to worry about, except massive complicated branches exist, which is very rare. Cycles If More threads than SPs In G80, there are 32 threads per warp but 8 SPs per SM. The num of thead in one warp is more than the number of SPs (ALUs). So the serial in warp is needed. When an SM schedules a warp: Its instruction is ready 8 threads enter the SPs on the 1st cycle 8 more on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cycles Therefore, 4 cycles are required to dispatch a warp In new archtecture, the number of SPs are way more than that of threads per warp. Number of warps to hide latency Example, a kernel has 1 global memory read (200 cycles) and 4 independent multiples/adds. How many warps are required to hide the memory latency in G80? Each warp has 4 MUL/ADDs, there are 16 cycles. Because 4 cycles in one wrap To conduct a global memory read, it has 200 cycles stall. We need to cover it by MUL/ADD cyckes. Cycles needed \\(ceil(200/16) = 13\\); 13 warps are needed for one block. Memory model Table Memory Device Host Scope Locality Latency Bandwidth Note registers R/W × thread On-chip Short *More register per thread, less thread per grid local R/W × thread global memory Long Automatic arrays shared R/W × bock on-chip Short *More memory per block, less block per grid. Full speed random access global R/W R/W grid off-chip Long 100 cycles GT200 -150 GB/s, G80 – 86.4 GB/s Up to 4 GB Random access causes performance hit constant R R/W grid global memory (cached) Short High Up to 64 KBWhen all threads access the same location * Increasing the number of registers used by a kernel , exceeding limit reduces threads by the block. For example, there are 8K registers, up to \\(768\\) threads per SM. \\(256\\) threads per block so \\(768/256\\) 3 blocks on SM. \\(8K/768 = 10\\) registers per thread. If each thread uses 11 registers. only 2 blocks can fit the register number. So only \\(2*256 = 512\\) threads on SM. \\(512*11 = 5.6K\\) registers are used. * For Shared Memory, the shared memory is \\(16\\)KB. \\(8\\) blocks per SM, then that's \\(16/8=2\\)KB per block. If each block uses 5 KB, obly 3 blocks a SM can host. * there is another Special Register used for build-in varibles, such as: threadIdx blockIdx blockDim gridDim Declaration Variable Declaration Memory Scope Lifetime Automatic variables other than arrays register thread kernel Automatic array variables local thread kernel __shared__ int sharedVar; shared block kernel __device__ int globalVar; global grid application __constant__ int constantVar; constant grid application Global and constant variables: Host can access with cudaGetSymbolAddress() cudaGetSymbolSize() cudaMemcpyToSymbol() cudaMemcpyFromSymbol() Constants is better (previously a must) be declared outside of a function body __constant__ float constData[256]; // global scope float data[256]; cudaMemcpyToSymbol(constData, data, sizeof(data)); cudaMemcpyFromSymbol(data, constData, sizeof(data)); Matrix multiply Again Problems that Still Exist Recall the limitations of the code from last time: Limited matrix size Only uses one block G80 and GT200 – up to 512 threads per block Lots of global memory access two store-read and pre MUL-ADD with the data in the same column, the same colmn data of N matrix is readed again and again. Same for the data in the same row. Its better if the colume data can be calculated with only one-time read of the column N.

Memory bandwidth no longer a limiting factor Each thread block should have many threads TILE_WIDTH of 16 gives 16*16 = 256 threads There should be many thread blocks A 1024*1024 Pd gives 64*64 = 4096 Thread Blocks Each thread block perform 2*256 = 512 float loads from global memory for 256 * (2*16) = 8192 mul/add operations. Memory bandwidth no longer a limiting factor Atomic functions arithmic operations bit operations atomicAdd(); atomicAnd(); atomicSub(); atomicOr(); atomicMin(); atomicXor(); atomicExch(); atomicMin(); atomicMax(); atomicAdd(); atomicDec(); atomicCAS(); Atomic operations are operations which are performed without interference from any other threads. Atomic operations are often used to prevent race conditions which are common problems in mulithreaded applications. For example, suppose you have two threads named A and B. Now suppose each thread wants to increase the value of memory location 0x1234 by one. Suppose the value at memory location 0x1234 is 5. If A and B both want to increase the value at location 0x1234 at the same time, each thread will first have to read the value. Depending on when the reads occur, it is possible that both A and B will read a value of 5. After adding a value of 1, both A and B will want to write 6 into the memory location, which is not correct! The value, 5, should have been increased twice (once by each thread), but instead, the value was only increased once! This is called a race condition, and can happen in any multi-threaded program if the programmer is not careful. Atomic operations in CUDA generally work for both shared memory and global memory. Atomic operations in shared memory are generally used to prevent race conditions between different threads within the same thread block. Atomic operations in global memory are used to prevent race conditions between two different threads across the blocks.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"CUDA","slug":"CUDA","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/CUDA/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"CUDA Programming 1","slug":"CUDA-fundamental-5","date":"2022-09-01T13:22:43.000Z","updated":"2022-09-02T13:50:22.512Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/09/01/CUDA-fundamental-5/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/09/01/CUDA-fundamental-5/","excerpt":"Basic CUDA programming methods, with a simple matrix multiply example constructed from the scratch.","text":"Basic CUDA programming methods, with a simple matrix multiply example constructed from the scratch.

For CPU memory, DDR is commonly used. GPU memory hierarchy Register - dedicated HW -single cycle Shared Memory - dedicated HW - single cycle Local Memory - DRAM (obstruct memory, actually saved in graphic memory), no cache - slow Global Memory - DRAM, no cache - slow Constant Memory - DRAM, cached - 1...10s...100s of cycles ,depending on cache locality Texture Memory - DRAM, cached - 1...10s...100s of cycles ,depending on cache locality Instruction Memory (invisible)- DRAM, cached In reality: GPU thread hierarchies Grid &gt;&gt; Block &gt;&gt; Thread One block contains several threads, one grid contains several blocks. Note: It is all obstruct concepts, how many threads or blocks is depends on the programmer. When running one program, also called Kernel, a Grid is activated, containing several Blocks. Inside one block, there is one Shared Memory and several Threads that can read the shared memory and synchronize _syncthreads_. thread mapping to the memory grid &lt;-&gt; Device block &lt;-&gt; SM thread &lt;-&gt; ALU In terms of CPU, there is a similar mapping:grid &lt;-&gt; multi coreblock &lt;-&gt; vector SSEthread &lt;-&gt; scalar SSE software thread memory accessibility Every thread has a Local memory, every block has a shared memory there is a global memory available for all the kernels/grids there is a constant memory available for all the kernels/grids, READ ONLY for the kernels but RW for the host (CPU). there is a host memory available for all the devices, if multiple devices are connected with the host. note that traditionally, the kernels are running in serial for each device, so that the kernel can get access to one global memory. But modern devices supports multiple kernels running parallel. The global memory will be divided for each kernels. Programming model Concepts Conventionally GPU is used for graphic processing, processing pixels and pixel blocks. The instructions on each pixels are the same, naturally parallel. So its suitable for SIMD. SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) Vector divided into pieces and run the same instruction SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread) SIMD is kind of a low-level concept, SIMT is slightly higher level, but logically they are identical. same instruction for multiple thread GPU version of SIMD massive threads model gives high parallelism tread switch gives latency hiding Programming language: Extended C Decorated C language.

The contents of the whole series are mainly collected from:NVIDIA CUDA初级教程视频CIS 565 2019CMU 15-418/618 (2018) Outline Why need GPU 3 design ideas to speedup examples GPU memory design Terms FLOPS Floating-point OPerations per Second GFLOPS One billion (10^9) FLOPS TFLOPS 1000 GFLOPS Why GPU Application Driven, many applications requires computation. GPU Structure A GPU is a heterogeneous chip multi-processor (highly tuned for graphics). Shader Core --&gt; ALU( Arithmetic logic unit ), basic computation unit. Before its designed specifically for image rendering, now it is able to perform general arithmetic operations. Execute shader Compared with the CPU types cores, there is no cache or extra OoO, branch predictor and memory pre-fetcher, which are not related to regulated instruction processing. 3 design idea to speedup Idea 1: multi “slimmed down cores” in parallel removing components that help a singe instruction stream run fast multi cores, multi fragments in parallel instruction stream sharing, multi fragments need to share one instruction stream. Otherwise a complicated control system is needed. Idea 2: multi ALUs in one core Amortize cost/complexity of managing an instruction stream across many ALUs. Design multiple ALUs in one core - SIMD. Vector operations in one core. For the overall design for now, there are 16 streams for 128 fragments, technically, the 16 streams can be same or different. The 8 ALUs in one core share the same stream. Branch divergence With multiple ALUs sharing one stream, the parallel performance will deteriorate dealing with branches such as below: if (x &gt; 0) &#123; y = pow(x, exp); y *= K3; ref = y * K3; &#125; else &#123; y = 0; ref = K3; &#125; When execute this thread, different ALU will get different true or flase. However, all the ALU's must execute the same path. As a result, as the image below shows, the ALUs going to Path B have to do useless work together with the ALUs who are doing the useful work. With a such branch, and 8-thread core, the performance can be as low as 1/8 peak performance. Just to clarify here, not all the SIMD process need explicit SIMD instruction. There are two options in total: explicit vectorized instructions, SSE for example implicit sharing managed by hardware, provide scalar instructions and the hardware share them. one scalar instruction is shared by multi-threads NVIDIA for example Stalls Stalls occur when a core cannot run the next instruction because of a dependency on a previous operation. Wait until ready. In order to deal with stalls, we have a third idea. Idea 3 Switch between different fragments to hide latency. Interleave processing of many fragments on a single core to avoid stalls caused by high latency operations. To maximise latency hiding, the context storage space is split into multiple components as demonstrated: Actually there are 3 level of context storage division: 18 small contexts, maximal latency hiding, fragments are small 12 medium contexts, 4 large contexts, more work for each fragments, but low latency hiding ability Just to clarify here, interleaving between contexts can be managed by hardware (HW) or software (SW) or both NIVIDIA / ATI Radeon GPUs (HW only) HW schedules / manages all contexts (lots of them) Special on-chip storage hods fragment states Intel Larrabee (Both) HW manages 4 x86 (big) contexts at fine granularity SW scheduling interleaves many groups of fragments on each HW context L1 - L2 cache holds fragment state (as determined by SW) Overall design Our overall design has the following specifications: 32 cores 16 mul-add ALUs per core (512 total) 32 simultaneous instruction streams 64 concurrent (but interleaved) instruction streams 512 concurrent fragments = 1 TFLOPs (@ 1GHz) Real designs MP = SM = core CUDA core = ALU CUDA thread = fragment The SM is the heart of NVIDIA’s unified GPU architecture. Most of the key hardware units for graphics processing reside in the SM. The SM’s CUDA cores perform pixel/vertex/geometry shading and physics/compute calculations. Texture units perform texture filtering and load/store units fetch and save data to memory. Special Function Units (SFUs) handle transcendental and graphics interpolation instructions. Finally, the PolyMorph Engine handles vertex fetch, tessellation, viewport transform, attribute setup, and stream output.

GPU memory design The importance of bandwidth GPU memory design Compare with CPU-Style core: The cache area in CPU is huge, and is is divided into 3 levels, L1, L2 and L3 caches. Inside the caches, the latency (length of stalls) is low and the bandwidth is big. Yet the bandwidth is low to the outside memory, as low as 12GB/s. The CPU cores run efficiently when data is resident in caches. In GPU (throughput style), no large cache hierarchy exists. As a result a high bandwidth to the memory is required, as high as 150GB/s. Although the GPU memory bandwidth is high, it is only 6 times to the CPU. It is still not enough compared with the compute performance of GPU(over 10 times to the CPU). Bandwidth thought experiment Task: element-wise multiply two long vectors A and B then plus C of the same length, save the result to vector D. here are the steps: Load input A[i] Load input B[i] load input C[i] Compute A[i]*B[i]+C[i] Store result into D[i] There are 4 memory operations (16 bytes) for every MUL-ADD operation. Radeon HD 5870 can do 1600 MUL-ADDs per clock Need ~20TB/s of bandwidth to keep ALUs busy It is less than 1% efficiency, but still 6x faster than CPU, because of the bandwidth limit. Bandwidth limited If processors request data at too high a rate, the memory system cannot keep up. No amount of latency hiding helps this. Overcoming bandwidth limits are a common challenge for GPU-compute application developers. In practice, when working on a large nerual networks, say BERT or GPT-2. The actual FLOPS will not reach the thoretical FLOPS calculated by the number of the matrix operations. The main reason are the activation layers and operation of SGD. They are compuational light yet memory heavy operations. The bandwidth will deter the calculation on these steps. Reducing bandwidth requirments Request data less often (do more math instead), \"arithmetic intensity\" Fetch data from memory less oftern (share/reuse data across fagments) on-chip communication or storage Examples Texture caches Capture reuse across fragments, not temporal reuse within a single shader program OpenCL \"local memory\", CUDA shared memory Note: OpenCL is an open standards version of CUDA - CUDA only runs on NVIDIA GPUs - OpenCL runs on CPUs and GPUs from many vendors - Almost everything about CUDA also holds for OpenCL - CUDA is better documented, thus I find it preferable to teach with. Mordern GPU memory hierarchy Shown on pictures above, the GPU possesses: On-chip storage takes load off memory system Many developers calling for more cache-like storage (particularly GPU-compute applications) A good GPU task Many many independent tasks exploiting massive ALUs many fragments switch to hide latency Shared instructions suitable for SIMD processes arithmitic intense task suitable commination and computation proportion not limited by share-load bandwidth References 15-740 Computer Architecture – Fall 2013 CMU 15-418/618 (2018) VIDEO: CMU15-418并行体系结构与编程（spring 2018）","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"CUDA","slug":"CUDA","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/CUDA/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"A collection of stupid Errors","slug":"A-collection-of-stupid-Errors","date":"2022-08-15T15:00:59.000Z","updated":"2022-09-09T15:23:23.793Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/08/15/A-collection-of-stupid-Errors/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/08/15/A-collection-of-stupid-Errors/","excerpt":"Warning: a set of stupid errors occur when compiling c++ and OpenFOAM.","text":"Warning: a set of stupid errors occur when compiling c++ and OpenFOAM. c++ this pointer in inherited template class I tried to write a simple snippet of inheriting template class, I wrote this simple code and it gave me such errors. #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; template &lt;class T&gt; class Base &#123; public: T m_data; &#125;; template &lt;class T&gt; class child_template: public Base&lt;T&gt; &#123; public: void print_child() &#123; cout &lt;&lt; m_data &lt;&lt; endl; // error: use of undeclared identifier &#x27;m_data&#x27;; did you mean &#x27;child_class::m_data&#x27;? // cout &lt;&lt; this-&gt;m_data &lt;&lt; endl; // no error &#125; &#125;; int main() &#123; child_template&lt;int&gt; child_obj; child_obj.m_data = 20; child_obj.print_child(); return 0; &#125; the error is such that: template_cls_inherit.cpp:17:17: error: use of undeclared identifier &#x27;m_data&#x27;; did you mean &#x27;__nl_cat_d::__data&#x27;? cout &lt;&lt; m_data &lt;&lt; endl; // error: use of undeclared identifier &#x27;m_data&#x27;; did you mean &#x27;child_class::m_data&#x27;? ^~~~~~ __nl_cat_d::__data /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/nl_types.h:90:8: note: &#x27;__nl_cat_d::__data&#x27; declared here void *__data; ^ template_cls_inherit.cpp:17:17: error: &#x27;__nl_cat_d::__data&#x27; is not a member of class &#x27;child_template&lt;int&gt;&#x27; cout &lt;&lt; m_data &lt;&lt; endl; // error: use of undeclared identifier &#x27;m_data&#x27;; did you mean &#x27;child_class::m_data&#x27;? ^~~~~~ template_cls_inherit.cpp:26:15: note: in instantiation of member function &#x27;child_template&lt;int&gt;::print_child&#x27; requested here child_obj.print_child(); ^ 2 errors generated.

There are two ways of storing a 2D matrix, 1D vector&lt;double&gt;, the most common way. The matrix is flattened as discussed above. 2D vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;, consistent with the Python/Julia/Matlab codes. How to represent a 2D matrix is not a c++ exclusive question. The languages above can also handling both 1D 2D matrix. 2D vector is adopted here for the sake of simplicity. Matrix operations There are 2 options for matrix operations Nested 2-layer for-loops to conduct the element-wised operations. Serial and slow it seems to be, but thanks to the compiler, it will be optimised to be data-level-parallel and the speed is ok. Besides, there is a fortran library BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), famous of the efficiency and high performance on matrix operations. BLAS has been widely used in the scientific computing field. It not only supports general full-populated matrix type, but also supports the triangular, symmetric and banded matrix computing. (Similar to the sparse matrix type in MATLAB, but less flexible) Here I choose option 1, still working on option 2. Since BLAS is written on Fortran, there are 2 ways of calling BLAS in C/C++Calling the Fortran BLAS library in C++, need extra attention on the matrix storage method*, and the compiling method*Use the CBLAS wrapper, may not work on all of the HPCs, but more convenient. The storage method can be pre-assigned when calling. No need to take care of the compiling method.*With a 2D matrix, there are two ways of storage in the memory, row-major or column-major. The convention is row-major but on Fortran, it is column-major. \\[\\begin{aligned}Conventional:&amp;\\quad \\left(\\begin{array}{lll}a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\\\a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\text { stored as }[\\underbrace{a_{11} a_{12} a_{13}}_{\\text {Row } 1} \\underbrace{a_{21} a_{22} a_{23}}_{\\text {Row } 2}] \\\\Fortran:&amp; \\quad\\left(\\begin{array}{lll}a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\\\a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\text { stored as }[\\underbrace{a_{11} a_{21}}_{\\text {Col. } 1} \\underbrace{a_{12} a_{22}}_{\\text {Col. } 2} \\underbrace{a_{13} a_{23}}_{\\text {Col. } 3}]\\end{aligned}\\]*The way Fortran and C++ compilers generate compiled forms of a function differ, so in order to use a Fortran code, we must tell the C++ compiler to look for the compiled symbol with a slightly different name than what it would otherwise expect. There are two main changes:Fortran appends the function name with an underscore (_), whereas C/C++ compilers do not.Since C++ supports function overloading (see Section 6.5), it “mangles” the function names with the parameter datatypes to ensure they are always unique.In order to call Fortran 90 functions from our C++ code, we therefore need to add the underscore and turn off the name mangling. Plotting methods: Although there is no official plotting library in C++, there are many libraries available, such as: GNUPlot, Koolplot, MATLAB, matplotlib-cpp. See plotting package for c++ in detail. I prefer GNUPlot, a fast and powerful, widely used plotting library. And There are two options of plotting, Joint: Embedding GNUPlot with C++ (with gnuplot-iostream), updates the plot real-time with iteration. Two-stage: First output all the data of every plotting step, then shade them with GNUPlot all together. In order to keep align with the codes in the last section, I choose the Joint method here.

Python is great Although Python is famous to be slow, but with numpy library (As far as I know, Anaconda numpy use OpenBLAS) it speed for matrix computation is not bad. Julia is NOT fast, at my level Actually, I wrote this blog aiming at learning Julia. I was hoping Julia can run as fast as C++ as they claimed. But the performance is the worst of all the codes. Maybe it is because of the JIM system. Or I need more time working on it. Besides, the plotting is inefficient. Again, it is not quite fair because I used Julia to call python API. I haven't look into the plotting function in Julia. For now, I'd rather use Python or MATLAB for quick preliminary developing and C++ for deploying. MATLAB has a really efficient plotting method, even I use octave as a alternative for now. I wander if I can seek the same plotting performance on C++.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fluid dynamics","slug":"fluid-dynamics","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/fluid-dynamics/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"CPU architecture","slug":"CUDA-fundamental-1","date":"2022-07-15T15:40:00.000Z","updated":"2022-09-02T13:00:10.268Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/07/15/CUDA-fundamental-1/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/07/15/CUDA-fundamental-1/","excerpt":"This is a very quick review on the CPU's fundamentals, in order to compare with GPU's when learning CUDA.","text":"This is a very quick review on the CPU's fundamentals, in order to compare with GPU's when learning CUDA.

Example of types of CPU instructions? arithmetic: add r3,r4 -&gt; r4 load-store: load [r4] -&gt; r7 sequencing/control: jz end Aim to be optimized: \\[ \\frac{cycles}{instructions} \\times \\frac{seconds}{cycle} \\] cycles per instructions(CPI) times time per cycle. cycle: 时钟周期 These two parameters are not independent, need trade-off. CPU programs: light threaded heavy memory access heavy branches very less arithmetic instructions. CPU structure Very large memory size (Shared L3 Cache) Controller (Memory Controller) - also for memory less calculators (Core) CPU related parallelisms Instructional level parallelism (ILP) (will talk about it very soon) Superscalar Out-of-Order Data-level parallelism (DLP) vectors Thread-level parallelism (TLP) simultaneous multithreading (SMT) multicore Pipelining Introduction Standard 5-stage pipeline: Fetch--&gt;Decode--&gt;Execute--&gt;Memory--&gt;Writeback 取址--&gt;译码--&gt;执行--&gt;访存--&gt;写回 instruction-level parallelism (ILP) √ reduce clock period × more latency and area ? dependent instructions -- Bypassing, Stall and OoO ? branching -- Branch Prediction / Branch Predication ? alleged pipeline lengths Core - 14, Pentium 4 (Prescott) - &gt;20, Sandy Bridge - medium Increase ILP: Superscalar, scheduling, out-of-order Bypassing sub R2, R3 -&gt; R7 add R1, R7 -&gt; R2 execute line 2 immediately after execute line 1, not until finishing of Memory and writeback of line1. Stall load [R3] -&gt; R7 add R1, R7 -&gt; R2 line 2 can only execute until the finishing of Memory and writeback of line1. The program have to wait. Branches jeq loop prediction of how the branch will go, or predication. Branches Branch Prediction Guess what's next, based on branch history. Modern predictors &gt;90% accuracy √ Raise performance and energy efficiency × Area increase and potentially latency (need time for guessing) Branch Predication Calculate results for all the conditions Replace branches with conditional instructions, Avoids branch predictor. √ no misprediction √ no area increase × unnecessary nop. GPUs also use predication Increasing IPC Superscalar Normal IPC is limited by the 1 instruction per clock setting. Superscalar is introduced to increase the pipeline width. √ IPC *N × Increase Area resources *N number of bypassing networks *N^2 more registers and memory bandwidth Sandy-Bridge has 6 ports, indicating 6 instructions per clock, managed by Scheduler. Scheduling Register Renaming/Aliasing Check out this piece of code: xor r1, r2 -&gt; r3 add r3, r4 -&gt; r4 sub r5, r2 -&gt; r3 addi r3, 1 -&gt; r1 line 1 and line 2, dependent (Read-After-Write, RAW) line 3 and line 4, dependent (RAW) line 1 and line 3 independent (Write-After-Write, WAW), maybe they can execute in parallel, but register r3 is used for both of the lines, can't run in parallel, without any modifications. So we introduce register renaming to rename r3 into different registers. xor p1, p2 -&gt; p6 add p6, p4 -&gt; p7 sub p5, p2 -&gt; p8 addi p8, 1 -&gt; p9 enable to parallel. Out-of-Order (OoO) Execution \"Shuffle\" the instructions to avoid waiting. A Journey Through the CPU Pipeline: Micro-ops can be processed out of order as long as their data is ready, sometimes skipping over unready micro-ops for a long time while working on other micro-ops that are ready. This way a long operation does not block quick operations and the cost of pipeline stalls is greatly reduced. Fetch -&gt; decode -&gt; Rename -&gt; Dispatch -&gt; issue -&gt; register read -&gt; execute -&gt; memory -&gt; writeback -&gt; commit Devices about OoO include: Reorder Buffer (ROB), record all the instructions state on execution. Issue Queue/Scheduler, choose next instruction Advantages and disadvantages: √ push IPC nearly to the ideal × increase area × increase consumption In-order CPUs: Intel Atom, ARM Cortex-A8, Qualcomm Scorpion OoO CPUs: Intel Pentium Pro and onwards, ARM Cortex-9 (Apple A5, NV Tegra 2/3)， Qualcomm Krait OoO is not available on some phones, which need area and low consumption Memory Hierarchy The bigger the memory, the slower it is, more delay it has.

schemes: first-order upwind scheme, no chance to be oscillatory, but very diffusive (smears the solution). second-order linear scheme, very accurate but oscillatory. In practice, with complex geometry, the oscillation can lead to an immediate divergence. \"1.5\"-order linearUpwind scheme, usually a good trade off between accuracy and oscillation.

In this blog we are going to multi-equation and artificial viscosity. overview: Systems of conservation laws Jacobian matrices, linearised equations, conservative and characteristic variables. Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. Boundary conditions. After dealing with the one-equation task, let's expand to a more general form, recall the 1D inviscid Euler equation in a form of vectors: Characteristic form Before moving forward, recall some linear algebra, consider a general 1st order hyperbolic PDE, \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{A}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{U}}{\\partial x}=0 \\] with a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), The PDE islinear if \\(\\mathbf{A} = const\\),quasi-linear if \\(\\mathbf{A} = f(\\mathbf{U},x,t)\\) The equation is hyperbolic, then \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is diagonalisable, which means \\[ \\exists \\mathbf{R}: \\mathbf{R^{-1} A R=\\Lambda}, \\quad\\text{where } \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\text{ is diagonal matrix} \\] and the diagonal elements \\(\\lambda_i\\) is the eigenvalues / characteristic values of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{r_i}\\) are the right eigenvectors / characteristic vectors of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Therefore, multiply by \\(\\mathbf{R^{-1}}\\) both sides of the PDE above to obtain: \\[ \\mathbf{R^{-1}}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{R^{-1}}\\mathbf{A}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{U}}{\\partial x}=0 \\] Define the characteristic variables \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) as \\(d\\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{R^{-1}}d\\mathbf{U}\\), we have the characteristic form equation: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{R^{-1}}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{R}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{V}}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{V}}{\\partial x}=0 \\end{aligned} \\] It is a wave form and be can decompose the system of PDE into a set of independent equations, such as the \\(i^{th}\\) equation: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V_i}}{\\partial t}+\\lambda_i\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{V_i}}{\\partial x}=0 \\] so that we can treat the equation as a set (3 for 3D, one for each equation) of independent advection equations, method of characteristics analysis we talked about before can be carried out for each sub-equations. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Characterstics/wavefronts: } \\qquad &amp;dx = \\lambda_idt,\\\\ \\text{Characterstic speeds/wave speeds: } \\qquad&amp; \\lambda_i \\end{aligned} \\] So far we have 3 forms:non-conservative form: no obvious advantage,conservative form: locate the shock well,characteristic form: decompose a system of equations into set of independent equations Euler equation Its time to introduce the 1D Euler equations: NS equations with 0 viscosity or heat conduction terms: Conservation form: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})}{\\partial x}=0 \\] for the quantity vector \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) with the flux vector \\(\\mathbf{F}\\), \\[ \\mathbf{U}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho \\\\ \\rho u \\\\ \\rho E \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{l} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mathbf{F(U)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho u \\\\ \\rho u^{2}+P \\\\ \\rho u\\left(E+\\frac{P}{\\rho}\\right) \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{l} F_1 \\\\ F_2 \\\\ F_3 \\end{array}\\right] \\] Primitive form: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{W}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{C}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{W}}{\\partial x}=0 \\] where: \\[ \\mathbf{W}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho \\\\ u \\\\ p \\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mathbf{C}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} u &amp; p &amp; \\\\ &amp;u &amp; \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\\\ &amp; \\rho c^2 &amp; u \\end{array}\\right] \\] and \\(c=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}}\\), speed of sound. Characteristic forms of Euler equation From conservative form Along with previous method, we can construct the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) for the conservative Euler equation, \\[ \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{U})=\\frac{d \\mathbf{F}}{d \\mathbf{U}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\gamma-3}{2} u^{2} &amp; (3-\\gamma) u &amp; \\gamma-1 \\\\ -\\gamma u E+(\\gamma-1) u^{3} &amp; \\gamma E-\\frac{3}{2}(\\gamma-1) u^{2} &amp; \\gamma u \\end{array}\\right] \\] and we have a non-conservation form of the Euler equation, same as the general equation above: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{A}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{U}}{\\partial x}=0 \\] It is actually non-linear PDE, but we can apply a linear approximation when dealing with small variations around mean values, and the linear approximation form is exactly the same as the non-linear form.Linear approximation steps:\\(\\mathbf{U}\\) can be expressed as a constant mean flow \\(\\mathbf{U_0}\\) with a small perturbation \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{U}}\\), substitute the expression into the conservative form of equation: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{(U_0 + \\tilde{U})}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{F(U_0 + \\tilde{U})}}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U_0}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{ \\tilde{U}}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{F(U_0 + \\tilde{U})}}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U_0}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{ \\tilde{U}}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{0}\\right)+\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}}{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{U}_{0}} \\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}\\right)}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\\\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U_0}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{0}\\right)}{\\partial x}}_{0}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{ \\tilde{U}}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{\\left.A\\right|_{U_0}}\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\\\end{aligned}\\] As a result, with \\(\\mathbf{A_0=A|_{U_0}}\\): \\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{ \\tilde{U}}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{A_0}\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}}{\\partial x}=0\\] With some further tedious calculations, we have \\[ \\mathbf{R}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\frac{\\rho}{2 c} &amp; -\\frac{\\rho}{2 c} \\\\ u &amp; \\frac{\\rho}{2 c}(u+c) &amp; -\\frac{\\rho}{2 c}(u-c) \\\\ \\frac{u^{2}}{2} &amp; \\frac{\\rho}{2 c}\\left(\\frac{u^{2}}{2}+\\frac{c^{2}}{\\gamma-1}+c u\\right) &amp; -\\frac{\\rho}{2 c}\\left(\\frac{u^{2}}{2}+\\frac{c^{2}}{\\gamma-1}-c u\\right) \\end{array}\\right] \\] where \\(c=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}}\\), speed of sound, and \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\): \\[ \\mathbf{\\Lambda}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} u &amp; &amp; \\\\ &amp;u+c &amp; \\\\ &amp; &amp; u-c \\end{array}\\right] \\] From primitive form The same \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\) can also be obtained by the primitive form of the Euler equation: We have \\(\\mathbf{Q^{-1}CQ=\\Lambda}\\) with， \\[ \\mathbf{Q}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\frac{\\rho}{2 c} &amp; -\\frac{\\rho}{2 c} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac{1}{2} &amp; \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac{\\rho c}{2} &amp; -\\frac{\\rho c}{2} \\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathbf{Q}^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\frac{1}{\\rho c} \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -\\frac{1}{\\rho c} \\end{array}\\right] \\] Therefore the characteristic equations \\(d \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{Q}^{-1} d \\mathbf{W}\\) become \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;d V_{1}=d \\rho-\\frac{d p}{c^{2}}=0 \\quad &amp;\\text{for} \\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u \\\\ &amp;d V_{2}=d u+\\frac{d p}{\\rho c}=0 \\quad &amp;\\text{for} \\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u+c \\\\ &amp;d V_{3}=d u-\\frac{d p}{\\rho c}=0 \\quad &amp;\\text{for}\\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u-c \\end{aligned} \\] Integrating we get \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;V_{1}=const\\quad &amp;\\text{for}\\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u \\quad(\\text { entropy wave) } \\\\ &amp;V_{2}=u+\\int \\frac{d p}{\\rho c}=const \\quad &amp;\\text{for} \\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u+c \\text { (acoustic wave) } \\\\ &amp;V_{3}=u-\\int \\frac{d p}{\\rho c}=const \\quad &amp;\\text{for} \\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u-c \\text { (acoustic wave) } \\end{aligned} \\] These 3 equations can not be solved properly, unless we introduce assumptions. Closure of Euler equation For the first equation \\(V_1\\), we need perfect gas. The equation of state can be used to quantify the specific entropy \\(s\\) \\[ s=c_{v} \\ln (p)-c_{p} \\ln (\\rho) \\] with \\(c^{2}=\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}\\), the ratio of specific heats with \\(\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{v}}\\), the constant pressure specific heat \\(c_{P}\\) and the constant volume specific heat \\(c_{v}\\). We have \\[ d s=-\\frac{c_{p}}{\\rho}\\left(d \\rho-\\frac{d p}{c^{2}}\\right)=-\\frac{c_{p}}{\\rho} d V_{1} \\] \\(d V_{1}=0 \\Rightarrow\\) entropy is constant along a path line \\(\\frac{d x}{d t}=u\\) The other 2 characteristic equations \\(V_2, V_3\\) can not be analytically integrated, unless further assumptions are made. For example, assume the flow is homentropic, which means that the entropy is constant everywhere. Inviscid flows are often homoentropic (except at shocks). We have \\[ p=A \\rho^{\\gamma} \\quad c=B \\rho^{(\\gamma-1) / 2} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\frac{A}{B^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\] We can show that \\(\\int \\frac{d p}{\\rho c}=\\frac{2 c}{\\gamma-1}+const.\\) which lead to \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;S=const &amp;\\text{ for }\\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u \\text { (entropy wave) } \\\\ &amp;V_{2}=u+\\frac{2 c}{\\gamma-1}=const \\quad &amp;\\text{ for }\\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u+c \\text { (acoustic wave) } \\\\ &amp;V_{3}=u-\\frac{2 c}{\\gamma-1}=\\text { const } \\quad &amp;\\text{ for } \\quad \\frac{d x}{d t}=u-c \\quad(\\text { acoustic wave) } \\end{aligned} \\] The characteristics \\(V_{2}\\) and \\(V_{3}\\) are also known as Riemann invariants. But \\(V_{2}\\) and \\(V_{3}\\) have no physical meaning. And this will be a problem in later section. At this point, the characteristics analysis can be applied, such as: Courant number checking Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition Characteristics method of Euler equation We have three families of characteristics: Characteristics which travel with the local flow speed \\(u\\) Characteristics which travel with the local flow speed \\(+\\) the local speed of sound \\(u+c\\) Characteristics which travel with the local flow speed \\(-\\) the local speed of sound $u-c $ The signal carried out by acoustic waves does not correspond to any well-known physical quantity. In a supersonic context, all the waves travel in the same direction (it is impossible to have a conversation in supersonic flows). Numerical methods can be easily chose. In a subsonic context, two wave speeds are positive and one wave speed is negative. That means we have to very carefully to design a numerical scheme considering information from all the directions. Boundary conditions problem Given the characteristics in supersonic and subsonic flows, the boundary condition must be carefully designed. As shown below, in the supersonic flow, \\(V_1,V_2,V_3\\) only need inlet boundary conditions. There is not a big problem. But in the subsonic condition, \\(V_1,V_2\\) need the inlet boundary conditions, while \\(V_3\\) needs the outlet boundary condition. Here comes the nightmare. In a subsonic regime, we can't asset the boundary condition for \\(V_1,V_2\\) and \\(V_3\\) exactly what they need, because they are non-physical. We don't have direct access of the Riemann variables, the only available conditions are just velocities and pressures. So the characteristic information might have to be defined in an iterative or approximate way Shock tube solution for Euler equations The famous shock tube have 3 regimes: Moving shock / shock wave: For the ID Euler equations, the second law of thermodynamics requires that the Mach number \\(M = u/c\\) must decrease from greater than one to less than one in a coordinate system moving with the shock. Centred expansion fan / rarefaction wave: expansion wave in which all characteristics originate from a single point in the \\(x—t\\) plane Contact discontinuity: occurs when the wave speed \\(\\lambda_1 = u\\) and pressure are continuous while other flow properties jump. In other words, for a contact discontinuity \\[ u_L=u_R \\quad and \\quad p_L=p_R \\] In multidimensional flows, contact discontinuities are also called slip lines or vortex sheets. Like shocks, contact discontinuities obey the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Unlike shocks, contacts cannot form spontaneously. Numerical schemes for non-linear conservation laws It is still an active research area and these are the classical methods:Centred schemes: one-step and two-step Lax Wendroff, MacCormack predictor-corrector. Artificial dissipation. Upwind schemes: flux vector and flux difference splitting. Monotone schemes: Godunov and Harten theorems. Exact and approximate Riemann solvers. High-order upwind schemes: the TVD property. The construction of TVD schemes using slope and flux limiters. WENO schemes: weighted essentially non-oscillatory methods Numerical schemes for Euler equations Cases to be tested Case 1: linear advection (\\(f(u)=u\\)) of a sine wave: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\text{with } u(x,0)=-sin(\\pi x) \\] Test on \\(t=30\\), i.e. \\(u(x,30)=u(x,0)\\) Case 2: Burger equation (\\(f(u)=\\frac{1}{2}u^2\\)) with Riemann problem, \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}u^2\\right) = 0, \\quad \\text{with } u(x, 0)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\text { if } &amp; |x|&lt;\\frac{1}{3} \\\\ -1 &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{1}{3}&lt;|x| \\leq 1 \\end{array}\\right. \\] Case 3: Euler equation with Riemann problem \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})}{\\partial x}=0 \\] \\[ \\mathbf{U}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho \\\\ \\rho u \\\\ \\rho E \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{l} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mathbf{F(U)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho u \\\\ \\rho u^{2}+P \\\\ \\rho u\\left(E+\\frac{P}{\\rho}\\right) \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{l} F_1 \\\\ F_2 \\\\ F_3 \\end{array}\\right] \\] and \\(c=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}}\\), speed of sound, \\(p=(\\gamma-1)\\rho(E-\\frac{u^2}{2})\\). \\[ \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{W}(x, 0)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{L}} \\text { if } x&lt;0 \\\\ \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{R}} \\text { if } x \\geq 0 \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\mathbf{W}_{L}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\rho_{L} \\\\ u_{L} \\\\ p_{L} \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1 K g / m^{3} \\\\ 0 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s} \\\\ 100,000 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\mathbf{W}_{R}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\rho_{R} \\\\ u_{R} \\\\ p_{R} \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 0.010 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3} \\\\ 0 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s} \\\\ 1,000 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\end{array}\\right] \\end{gathered} \\] Lax-Friedrichs Method Recall last time derivation for case 1 and 2: \\[ U^{n+1}_i = \\frac{U^n_{i+1}+U^n_{i-1}}{2} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{F^n_{i+1}-F^n_{i-1}}{2} \\right) \\] for case 3: \\[ \\begin{gathered} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})}{\\partial x}=0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{U}) \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\ \\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n+\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n\\right)-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n-\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n\\right) \\end{gathered} \\] case 1 result The dissipation effect is huge, but from last blog, we know it can be controlled with higher resolution of \\(\\Delta x, \\Delta t\\). (consistent, diffusivity controlled by CFL) How to control the diffusivity? We can write the scheme in the artificial viscosity form, which will be discussed later. case 2 result Odd-even oscillations exist, but no over/under shoot. case 3 results Odd-even oscillations exist. The results are smoothed out. It's difficult to capture the discontinuity of density and pressure. But the results will be fine with increased resolution. Lax-Wendroff Method Recall the derivation last time, consider a Taylor serie for \\(\\mathrm{U}(x, t+\\Delta t)\\) \\[ \\mathbf{U}(x, t+\\Delta t)=\\mathbf{U}(x, t)+\\Delta t \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}(x, t)}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{U}(x, t)}{\\partial t^2}+O\\left(\\Delta t^3\\right) \\] The temporal derivative can be transformed in spatial derivative using the original conservation laws \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}(x, t)}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F(U)}}{\\partial x} = -\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{U}) \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial x}\\\\ \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{U}(x, t)}{\\partial t^2}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}\\right)=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F(U)}}{\\partial x}\\right) &amp;=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F(U)}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\\\ &amp;=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\mathbf{A(U)} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\mathbf{A(U)} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F(U）}}{\\partial x}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Put the two expressions into the Taylor series, discretise using central differences: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{U}^{n+1}_i=&amp;\\mathbf{U}^n_i-\\Delta t \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}^n_{i+1})-\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}^n_{i-1})}{2\\Delta x}+ \\\\ &amp;\\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\frac{\\mathbf{A}_{i+1 / 2}^n\\frac{\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}^n_{i+1})-\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}^n_{i})}{\\Delta x} -\\mathbf{A}_{i-1 / 2}^n\\frac{\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}^n_{i})-\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}^n_{i-1})}{\\Delta x}} {\\Delta x^2} \\end{aligned} \\] There are two choice of defininig \\(\\mathbf{A}_{i+1 / 2}^n\\), \\(\\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n\\right)\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{A}_i^n+\\mathbf{A}_{i+1}^n\\right)\\), taking \\(\\mathbf{U}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\\) to calculate \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) or average \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) from the its neighbouring time steps. Recall that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a matrix with 9 elements, and it is a function of \\(x\\) and \\(t\\). i.e. \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) updates with every time step at every nodes. And this will lead to a cost problem In the Lax-Wendroff method, the average wave speeds \\(\\mathbf{A}_{i+1 / 2}^n\\) may be defined in a variety of different ways. It is actually an entire class of methods depending on the choice of the wave speeds. Furthermore, we write the Lax-Wendroff method in conservation form: \\[ \\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1}=\\mathbf{U}_i^n-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n-\\mathbf{F}_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}^n\\right) \\] with \\[ \\mathbf{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)+\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n\\right)}{2}-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} \\mathbf{A}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)\\right) \\] for case1 and 2, the linear advection equation, \\(f(u)=a u\\) it takes the form \\[ u_i^{n+1}=u_i^n-\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n-u_{i-1}^n\\right)+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n-2 u_i+u_{i-1}^n\\right) \\] where \\(\\sigma=a \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\). The corresponding conservative flux is \\[ F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n=a \\frac{u_i^n+u_{i+1}^n}{2}-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} a^2\\left(u_{i+1}^n-u_i^n\\right) \\] case 1 result The Lax Wendroff result slightly shifted (delay), because the schemes is not consistent as discussed in last blog. It can beed seen that the Lax Wendroff method is not suitable for simple non-discontinue problems. case 2 result Here the rarefaction wave is not captured, WRONG SOLUTION! As discussed before, the conservation form locates the shock perfectly but the result cannot be guaranteed as physical. And it is not suitable for system of conservation. There is no need to test case 3 because we know it will have a slight delay, and wrong solution. Two-step Lax-Wendroff Method (Richtmyer method) This is an optimisation of Lax-Wendroff. The idea is to reduce the cost by the \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) matrix There are two options: Option 1: Approximate matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\): Still too expensive. Option 2: Avoid computation of matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (Jacobian free methods): Richtmyer method introducing intermedia time steps \\(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\) as follows Step 1 \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\mathbf{U}_{i+1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n+\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)\\right) \\\\ &amp;\\mathbf{U}_{i-1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n+\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n\\right)-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Step 2 \\[ \\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1}=\\mathbf{U}_i^n + \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{U}_{i}^{n+1 / 2}}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{U}_i^n-\\Delta t\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{F}_{i}^{n+1 / 2}}{\\partial x} = \\mathbf{U}_i^n-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left[\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i-1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}\\right)\\right] \\] Conservative form are used to avoid the calculation of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) matrix. This first step is called the predictor (here Lax-Friedriechs method) The second step is called the corrector (here Leapfrog method) The idea is inspired from the Two-step runge–kutta methods for ordinary differential equations. Apart from the standard grid \\(x_i\\); another the staggered grid \\(x_{i+ 1/2} = (x_{i+1} + x_i )/2\\) lies halfway between the standard grid points. Staggered grids are extremely common in predictor-corrector methods. case 3 results The result is highly diffusive on the shock. For velocity, although the shock and rarefaction wave are captured, oscillations exist because of the second order. For pressure, a slight overshoot also exit on the upstream of the shock. Note the scheme is upwind, so if there is a bidirectional supersonic flow, this scheme will not work well. Two-step MacCormack’s method This is another variance of the two step lax wandroff method, and it is one of the most used method for compressible flow. The idea is to combine upwind and downwind method so that the bidirectional supersonic wave can be evaluated well. Predictor step: 1st order upwind (first guess) \\[ \\mathbf{U}_i^*=\\mathbf{U}_i^n-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)\\right) \\] Corrector step: 1st order down wind \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat U}_i= \\mathbf{U}_i^* + \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{U}_i^*}{\\partial t}= \\mathbf{U}_i^* - \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}_i^*)}{\\partial t} =\\mathbf{U}_i^*-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left[\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^*\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^*\\right)\\right] \\] Finally step, average \\[ \\mathbf{U}_i^n = (\\mathbf{\\hat{U}}_{i}+\\mathbf{U}_{i}^{*})/2 \\] The predictor and corrector in MacCormack’s method can be reversed depending if we have left-running or right-running waves. The two versions of MacCormack’s method are often combined to a mix of left and right running waves. The predictor or corrector are both unconditionally unstable, yet the sequence is stable if \\(CFL&lt;1\\). The MacCormack’s method is still second order although two two steps are first order.Even with the sophisticated methods available today, many people still turn to MacCormack’s method first, especially in the absence of shocks, mainly because of its simplicity and efficiency. case 3 result Oscillation with shocks because the second order. Artificial viscosity Artificial viscosity for Scalar Conservation Law Firstly, recall the difference between diffusion and dispersion. Diffusion(left) means the smearing effect with convection, while dispersion(right) represents the effect of oscillation. We are seeking a method to control the balance of diffusion and dispersion of a numerical method. The idea of artificial viscosity is that, there is no viscous terms in Euler equations but we can have some viscous effect (diffusive effects) inside numerical methods. For example, a scalar conservation law with a viscous-like term (like in N-S): A conservative forward \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(d(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right)\\\\ \\] where \\(d(u)\\) is the viscous term and it should be as small as possible. Besides, unlike the constant real viscosity in the N-S, \\(d\\) can be non-constant locally. Use central difference to discretise this formula as: \\[ \\frac{u_i^{n+1}-u_i^n}{\\Delta t}+\\frac{f\\left(u_{i+1}^n\\right)-f\\left(u_{i-1}^n\\right)}{2 \\Delta x}=\\frac{d_{i+1 / 2} \\frac{u_{i+1}^n-u_i^n}{\\Delta x} - d_{i-1 / 2} \\frac{u_i^n-u_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x}}{\\Delta x} \\] A oscillatory scheme can be controlled by introducing diffusion, i.e. artificial viscosity. Artificial Viscosity Form Take The Lax-Friedrich's method as an example, the conservative form can be written in the artificial viscosity form. Non-conservative form: \\[ u_i^{n+1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(u_{i-1}^n+u_{i+1}^n\\right)-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left[f\\left(u_{i+1}^n\\right)-f\\left(u_{i-1}^n\\right)\\right] \\] Conservative form: \\[ u_i^{n+1}=u_i^n-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left[F_{i+1 / 2}^n-F_{i-1 / 2}^n\\right]$ with $F_{i+1 / 2}^n=\\frac{\\Delta x}{2 \\Delta t}\\left(u_i^n-u_{i+1}^n\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left[f\\left(u_i^n\\right)+f\\left(u_{i+1}^n\\right)\\right] \\] Artificial viscosity form: \\[ u_i^{n+1}=u_i^n-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left[f\\left(u_{i+1}^n\\right)-f\\left(u_{i-1}^n\\right)\\right]+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left[d_{i+1 / 2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n-u_i^n\\right)-d_{i-1 / 2}\\left(u_i^n-u_{i-1}^n\\right)\\right] \\] with \\(d_{i+1 / 2}=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\), Most of the schemes can be written in artificial viscosity form so that one can quantify the diffusivity by inspecting the \\(d_{i+1 / 2}\\). We can as a result analysis, then control the diffusivity of a scheme.For example for Lax-Friedrich's method:reduce $x $, the diffusivity will be reduced.reduce \\(\\Delta t\\) the diffusivity will be increased.The dissipation can be easily controlled by increasing the space resolution, or selecting the highest possible CFL number. Some points: The discretisation of this term does not need to be acurate; all we want is to have desirable numerical effects. Implicit artificial viscosity: arises naturally as part of the discretisation of the first derivative. Explicit artificial viscosity: added on purpose to remove oscillations. Artificial Viscosity for System of Conservation Laws For systems of conservation laws, the artificial dissipation term can be considered a discretisation of \\[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\mathbf{D(u)} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial x}\\right)\\\\ \\] where \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is used to add explicit artificial dissipation on the scheme to control the high-frequency oscilations. This is analogous to \\[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(d(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right)\\\\ \\] for scalar conservation laws as seen in previous subsection. Requirement for artificial dissipation The (explicit) dissipation matrix \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) should satisfy: The dimensions of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) are those of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Its influence in smooth regions should be negligible. It should act only around discontinuities (i.e in areas with strong gradients). It should be non-linear, i.e. depends on \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) should be proportional to, at least, \\(\\Delta x\\) in order to maintain second-order accuracy. Different schemes may need different levels of dissipation. Explicit artificial dissipation terms are added to the numerical flux. For example, the Richtmyer method with this sort of artificial viscosity becomes Step 1, not changed \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\mathbf{U}_{i+1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n+\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)\\right) \\\\ &amp;\\mathbf{U}_{i-1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n+\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n\\right)-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_i^n\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Step 2, add artificial viscosity \\[ \\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1}= \\mathbf{U}_i^n-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left[\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i+1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}\\right)-\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{i-1 / 2}^{n+1 / 2}\\right)\\right] +d[\\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n-\\mathbf{U}_{i}^n+\\mathbf{U}_{i-1}^n] \\] But both Richtmyer and MacCormack’s methods remain oscillate with artificial viscosity. For the Euler equations, without artificial viscosity, neither MacCormack’s method nor the Richtmyer method can complete the first time step without overshooting and creating negative pressures. Both methods take two time steps with a constant coefficient of second-order artificial viscosity d = 0.02. After the first two time steps have smoothed the initial conditions, both methods are able to continue without artificial viscosity. Overshoots and oscillations without continued use of artificial viscosity.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fluid dynamics","slug":"fluid-dynamics","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/fluid-dynamics/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Numerical schemes fundamentals","slug":"FVM-schemes-fundamentals","date":"2022-06-18T10:08:24.000Z","updated":"2022-09-27T12:35:57.471Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/06/18/FVM-schemes-fundamentals/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/06/18/FVM-schemes-fundamentals/","excerpt":"This is the essence of CFD, advecting with the discontinuities due to inviscid fluid PDEs.

Overview: Scalar conservation laws 1-D theory. Examples of 1-D hyperbolic conservation laws. Characteristics discontinuities and jump conditions. Weak solutions and entropy condition. Linear versus non-linear advection Challenges As we all know, flow fluids are governed by 3 hyperbolic PDEs (conservation of mass, momentum and energy). These equations are highly non-linear and they can lead to discontinuities even with a smooth initial conditions, which is very difficult to solve numerically. Simple FDM will definitely fail on these discontinuities and shocks. Recall the incompressible NS equation that we've learned in the kindergarten: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t} + \\underbrace{\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{V}\\right)\\mathbf{V}}_{\\text{convection}} = \\frac{\\nabla p}{\\rho} + \\mathbf{g}+ \\underbrace{\\nu \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}^2\\mathbf{V}}_{\\text{diffusion}} \\] the viscous diffusion term in the equation leads to parabolic equations with smooth solutions, which will save our life. But with very high \\(Re\\), the equation reduces to pure hyperbolic inviscid Euler Equation, and the resultant discontinuity is a nightmare for most of the numerical schemes. The presence of discontinuities requires weak solutions, as oppose to strong solutions. However, the weak solutions give up the uniqueness in math, i.e there exist a large number of solutions that may not be physical acceptable, i.e. extra conditions are needed to justify the solution. They are: Rankine-Hugoniot condition deals with the discontinuity Entropy condition satisfies the physics Just here to remind that we are dealing with inviscid flow, shocks, nothing to do with turbulence. Scalar conservation law 1D law First let's introduce a simple example to present the problem: consider an 1D control volume \\([a,b]\\), during the time interval \\([t_1,t_2]\\) . The scalar conservation law can be stated as that during \\([t_1,t_2]\\) , change in total conserved quantity in \\([a,b]\\) equals the net flux through the boundaries \\(a\\), \\(b\\): \\[ \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_a^bu(x,t) = -\\left[f(u(b,t))-f(u(a,t))\\right] \\] where \\(u(x,t)\\) is called the conserved quantity while \\(f\\) denotes the flux. This equation often describes the transport phenomena. You can not create, you can not destroy. Integral, differential conservative and primitive forms The 1D law can be extended in 2D with the relation, in integral form. \\[ \\frac{d}{d t} \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{u} d \\Omega+\\int_{\\Gamma} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{u}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} d \\Gamma=0 \\] The FVM and FEM solves the integral form, while the FDM solves the primitive form. Apply the Gauss divergence theorem the relation can be represented as differential form: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{u})\\right\\} d \\Omega=0&amp; \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\color{purple}{ \\forall \\Omega,\\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{u})=0} &amp; \\end{aligned} \\] above is called the differential conservative form. The only \\(u\\) changed in time is due to the flux \\(f\\). There is no extra assumptions introduced. In comparison, with an assumption of \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{f}}{d\\mathbf{u}}\\), the equation can be rewritten with the chain rule, as the differential primitive form : \\[ \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{u})\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}=0, \\quad \\text{where }\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{f}}{d\\mathbf{u}} \\] This form is identical to above in mathematics, but it will lead to problems numerically when dealing with discontinuities (to be discussed later). Rankine-Hugoniot Jump condition When dealing with discontinuities, the integral form is well defined, but not the differential forms. The differential solvers can't deal with the drastic derivatives so instead they solve an extra jump condition which can be derived from the well-defined integral form (discussed later). For an 1D jump discontinuity travelling at the speed \\(s\\): \\[ f(u_r)-f(u_l) = s(u_r-u_s) \\] where \\(u_r\\), \\(u_l\\) represent the speeds just at the left and the right of the discontinuity. 1D Euler equations Its time to introduce the 1D Euler equations: NS equations with 0 viscosity or heat conduction terms: \\[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho \\\\ \\rho u \\\\ \\rho E \\end{array}\\right]+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[\\begin{array}{l} \\rho u \\\\ \\rho u^{2}+P \\\\ \\rho u\\left(E+\\frac{P}{\\rho}\\right) \\end{array}\\right]=0 \\] And the conservation form is: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{q})}{\\partial x}=0 \\] for the quantity vector \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) with the flux vector \\(\\mathbf{F}\\). Conservation vs non-conservation form Similar to before, with terms in a form of \\(\\partial_x{uv}\\): \\[ \\frac{\\partial uv}{\\partial x} \\neq u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+ v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\] When dealing with the discontinuities, the conservative LHS locates the shock directly, while the non-conservative RHS does not. (to be discussed later) Close the Euler equation Unlike the well-posed NS equation, in Euler equation, we have 4 unknowns but only 3 equations. So an extra state equation, i.e. extra assumption of the gas state is needed. Sometimes it's the idea gas assumption \\(p = \\rho RT\\), but for high \\(Re\\) compressible flows, equations of state are required to describe the relation between \\(p, \\rho \\text{ and }T\\). We are going to use the 1D Euler equations to evaluate the numerical methods. Analytical solutions of Euler equations Linear Advection Equation In 1D, the linear advection law for \\(u(x,t)\\) is: \\[ \\color{purple} \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} + a(u)\\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial x} = 0 \\] where \\(a(u)\\) denotes the advection speed. Plus an initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) and boundary condition (discuss later). solution This is a simple 2-variable PDE and we can apply the method of characteristics: Imagine a characteristic line \\(s\\), we have the chain rule: \\[ \\frac{d u(x,t)}{d s} = \\frac{d t}{d s}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{d x}{d s} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\] As a result we can construct, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d u(x,t)}{d s} = 0,\\quad\\frac{d t}{d s}=1, \\quad \\frac{d x}{d s}= a \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d u}{0}=\\frac{d t}{1}=\\frac{d x}{a}= d s \\end{aligned} \\] Select the available equations we have the characteristic equation: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d x}{d t} &amp;= a \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad x &amp;= x_0 + a(u)t \\end{aligned} \\] If \\(u(x_0,0)=u_0\\), then \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=a(u_0)\\), the characteristic equation is therefore: \\[ \\color{purple} x = x_0 + a(u_0)t \\] And the solution to the problem is: \\[ u(x,t) = f(x_0) = f(x-a(u_0)t) \\] Linear Advection Equation Example Solve the following advection equation where \\(a = 0.5\\) \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x }= 0 \\] with initial condition \\[ u(x,0) = exp(-32x^2) \\] solution The characteristics are straight lines in the \\((x,t)\\) plane: \\[ x = 0.5t+x_0 \\] And the solutions are therefore: \\[ u(x,t) = f(x_0) = exp(-32(x-0.5t)^2) \\] Inviscid Burgers' equation In 1D, the inviscid Burgers' equation for \\(u(x,t)\\) is: \\[ \\color{purple} \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} + \\frac{f(u) }{\\partial x} = 0,\\quad\\text{where }f(u)=\\frac{1}{2}u^2 \\] The conservative form for this equation： \\[ \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial(\\frac{1}{2}u^2) }{\\partial x} = 0 \\] and the primitive form: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial x} = 0 \\] same form as the 1D linear advection equation with \\(a(u)=u\\). Burgers' equation Example Solve the advection equation: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x }= 0 \\] with initial condition: \\[ u(x,0) = 1-\\cos(x) \\] solution Similarly, the characteristics are described by: \\[ x = x_0 + ut \\] and the solution: \\[ u = 1-\\cos(x-ut) \\] which is implicit. It is can be plotted anyway: discussion For non-linear conservation laws, the characteristics may cross within finite time. This would suggest a multi-valued solution which does not make sense physically. Where the characteristics start crossing, the solution become discontinuous. And the formation of discontinuities is possible even for smooth initial data. So the differential primitive form of the equations is no longer valid \\(\\Rightarrow\\) only the integral form can deal with discontinuities. And the differential form can be completed by a jump condition derived from the integral form. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) we need weak solutions. The mathematical theory of partial differential equations introduces the concept of weak solutions. Rankine-Hugoniot condition The Riemann Problem In order to understand the behaviour of the solution at discontinuities, it is useful to start with a simplified problem. The Riemann problem is a conservation law with a single discontinuity. \\[ \\color{purple} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} = 0 \\] with \\[ \\color{purple} u(x, 0)= \\begin{cases}u_{L} &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ u_{R} &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\] Shock Path Take the control volume between boundaries \\(x_L\\) and \\(x_R\\), which are taken sufficient close to the shock so that spatial variations of the solution become unimportant. and are taken sufficient apart from the shock so that the boundary will note interfere with the shock motion over time interval \\(\\delta t\\). Recall the integral function: \\[ \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{x_L}^{x_R}udx = f(u_L)-f(u_R) \\] If the position of the shock is \\(x = X(t)\\), with \\(x_L&lt; X (t) &lt;x_R\\), the values of \\(u(x,t)\\) inside the integral are close to the constants \\(u_L\\) and \\(u_R\\) and we can write: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{x_L}^{X}u_Ldx + \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{X}^{x_R}u_Rdx= f(u_L)-f(u_R)\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[(x_L-X)u_L + (X-x_R)u_R\\right]= f(u_L)-f(u_R)\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Given the shock speed (slope of the shock path) \\(s = \\frac{dX}{dt}\\), we have: \\[ \\begin{aligned} s\\left(u_L - u_R\\right)&amp;= f(u_L)-f(u_R)\\\\ \\color{purple} s= \\frac{dX}{dt}&amp;\\color{purple} = \\frac{f(u_L)-f(u_R)}{\\left(u_L - u_R\\right)}= \\frac{f(u_R)-f(u_L)}{\\left(u_R - u_L\\right)} \\end{aligned} \\] The equation above is the Rankine-Hugoniot condition, also called the \"jump condition\". Correspondingly, weak solutions represents the solutions of the PDE where the solution is smooth and of a Rankine-Hugoniot condition at discontinuities. And they are not unique. Strong solution \\(\\Rightarrow\\) weak solutionWeak solution \\(\\nLeftarrow\\) Strong solution Non-uniqueness of weak solutions Example of Riemann Problem with Burgers's equation Consider the Burgers' equation under a Riemann Problem: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x }&amp;= 0, \\\\ \\text{with } u(x, 0)&amp;= \\begin{cases}1 &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\] The characteristics are of the form: \\(x = x_0 + ut\\) In \\(x-t\\) plane, the characteristics line: \\[ \\begin{cases} x = t - x_0 &amp; x_0 \\leq 0 \\\\ x = x_0 &amp; x_0 &gt; 0\\end{cases} \\] And the according to the Rankine-Hugonoit condition, the speed of the shock is: \\[ s = \\frac{f(u_L)-f(u_R)}{\\left(u_L - u_R\\right)}= \\frac{-1/2-0}{\\left(1-0\\right)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\] and the shock path is: \\[ x = \\frac{1}{2} t \\] therefore, the solution is: \\[ u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; x \\leq \\frac{1}{2}t \\\\ 0 &amp; x&gt; \\frac{1}{2}t\\end{cases} \\] Riemann Problem with Burgers's equation For the upwind case: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x }&amp;= 0, \\\\ \\text{with } u(x, 0)&amp;= \\begin{cases}u_L &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ u_R &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\] with \\(u_L&gt;u_R\\). And the shock is created with a speed: \\[ s = \\frac{1}{2}(u_R+u_L) \\] and the solution: \\[ u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_L &amp; x \\leq \\frac{1}{2}t \\\\ u_R &amp; x&gt; \\frac{1}{2}t\\end{cases} \\] Example of non-unique reverse Riemann Problem with Burgers's equation Reverse the initial condition in the previous example: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x }&amp;= 0, \\\\ \\text{with } u(x, 0)&amp;= \\begin{cases}0 &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\] the characteristics become: Solution in the blue area (\\(0&lt;x&lt;t\\)) is not defined. So here proposes 2 possible solutions, both are mathematical acceptable: Solution A: \\[ u(x, t)= \\begin{cases}0 &amp; \\text { if } \\quad \\frac{x}{t}&lt;s(=0.5) \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text { if } \\quad \\frac{x}{t}&gt;s(=0.5)\\end{cases} \\] Solution B: \\[ u(x, t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{x}{t}&lt;0 \\\\ \\frac{x}{t} &amp; \\text { if } &amp; 0&lt;\\frac{x}{t}&lt;1 \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{x}{t}&gt;1 \\end{array}\\right. \\] A little spoiler alert there: Solution B is physical, discussed in the next section. Exact solution to Riemann Problem with Burgers's equation In conclusion, For the Riemann Problem with Burgers's equation: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x }&amp;= 0, \\\\ \\text{with } u(x, 0)&amp;= \\begin{cases}u_L &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ u_R &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\] with \\(u_L&gt;u_R\\) A shock wave is created with a speed: \\[ V_s = \\frac{u_L+u_R}{2} \\] and the exact solution is: \\[ u(x, t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc} u_L &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{x}{t}\\leq V_s \\\\ u_R &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{x}{t}&gt;V_s \\end{array}\\right. \\] with \\(u_L&lt;u_R\\) the exact solution is the rarefaction wave: \\[ u(x, t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc} u_L &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{x}{t}&lt;0 \\\\ \\frac{x}{t} &amp; \\text { if } &amp; 0&lt;\\frac{x}{t}&lt;1 \\\\ u_R &amp; \\text { if } &amp; \\frac{x}{t}&gt;1 \\end{array}\\right. \\] if \\(u_L = -u_R\\), we have a sonic rarefaction wave. Entropy Conditions Why solution A is wrong? we need to impose additional conditions. There are two ways. Add a small diffusion term (2 nd order) manually on the RHS to remove the discontinuity. The weak solution then must satisfy: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u^\\epsilon}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f(u^\\epsilon)}{\\partial x} = \\epsilon\\frac{\\partial^2u^\\epsilon}{\\partial x^\\epsilon} \\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the viscosity coefficient, it introduces the dissipation, known as the vanishing viscosity concept, into the equation to smooth the solution. A little bit cheating but most of people do this. Add the entropy solution I first hearted Entropy back in my undergraduate thermodynamic course. But I still don't know what is Entropy. So here are some answers:In gas dynamics, entropy is a constant physical quantity along particles in smooth flow which can jump to a higher value through a shock.The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy can never go down.For an evolution equation the information should always flow from the initial data.We can see it is very difficult to define it, but in order to translate the defination into the entropy condition, we see entropy as the extra amount of energy that is not available to the system. There are again two options of entropy condition: Convex (concave) fluxes / Lax entropy condition \\[ f&#39;(u_L) &gt; s &gt; f&#39;(u_R) \\] and the characteristics must run into the shock, not emerge from it. Oleinik entropy condition Similar to Lax entropy condition, it says: \\[ \\frac{f(u)-f(u_L)}{u-u_L}\\geq s \\geq \\frac{f(u_R)-f(u)}{u_R-u} \\] and Lax and Oleinik are equivalent if \\(f(u)\\) is strictly convex i.e. \\(f&#39;&#39;(u)&lt;0\\). Numerical representation of discontinuities Requirements on numerical schemes. Conservative discretisation: Lax-Wendroff theorem. First versus second order schemes. Representation of discontinuities: physical aspects, shock fitting/capturing. Problems with Lax Equivalence Theorem There are 3 fundamental properties of a numerical scheme: Consistency: how good you approximate operators and functions. Convergence: error between the exact and discrete solutions converges to zero. Stability: solution of the difference equation is not too sensitive to small perturbations. The convergence needs to be evaluated with exact solutions. So we always need analytical solutions to verify it. If we don't have access to the analytical solutions, we have a Lax Equivalence Theorem says \\[ \\text{consistency + stability $\\Rightarrow$ convergence} \\] It is a fundamental convergence theorem but it is valid only for linear PDEs and there is no non-linear equivalent theorem this theorem does not tell if the weak solution physically acceptable or not. For non-linear PDEs, we only have one experience, If a scheme is stable on linear PDEs, it will often (not all the time) be stable on non-linear PDEs. If a scheme is unstable on linear, it won't be stable on non-linear. So the work flow is, 1. Given a non-linear PDE, 2. Linearise it to explore the stabilities of schemes on it. 3. Test the winners on non-linear PDEs. Schemes on linear advection equation First we consider a 1D linear case, linear advection equation: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\] with \\(a\\) a positive scalar constant, representing the wave speed. So we have: \\[ f(u) = au \\] Base finite difference scheme try to solve it numerically, with finite difference, Euler forward difference in time and central difference in space. we have: \\[ \\frac{u^{n+1}_i-u^n_i}{\\Delta t} + a \\frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x} = 0 \\] \\[ u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i-1}}{2} \\right) \\] It is consistency, and the Von Neumann analysis shows it is stable if the CFL condition (Courant number \\(a\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}&lt;1\\)) is satisfied. It should converge to the exact solution. Numerical practice Consider a convection equation \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\] with a Riemann initial condition \\[ u(x, 0)= \\begin{cases} 1.2 &amp;x \\leq 0 \\\\ 0.4 &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\] The Euler in time, central difference in space scheme is applied on fortran script (base.f90, all the scripts in this post are annotated and modified from my graduate CFD course material). And the result is shown here: And the solver crashed, which means the scheme is unstable. And with finer mesh and smaller time step (controlled by Courant number), the scheme still does not converge to the exact solution. Lax-Friedrich's scheme Lax-Friedrich replaces the term \\(u^n_i\\) by the average \\(u^n_i = \\frac{1}{2}(u^n_{i+1}+u^n_{i-1})\\), \\[ u^{n+1}_i = \\underbrace{\\frac{u^n_{i+1}+u^n_{i-1}}{2}}_{\\text{only change}} - \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i-1}}{2} \\right) \\] Numerical practice Based on the same equation and initial condition, with same time &amp; space intervals, iteration times, Courant numbers, the Lax-Friedrich's scheme in time, central difference in space is applied (Lax-Friedrichs_scheme.f90). And the result is shown here: This scheme is a little better there are oscillations yet with smaller \\(\\Delta x\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\), the oscillations are smoothed out. the solution does not converge to the exact. This scheme is highly diffusive and the discontinuity is more smoothed out with higher resolution. The location of the shock is not captured. 1st order Upwind method Keep the Euler forward time difference, give up the order of the spatial central difference scheme to have a first order backward/forward scheme as: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}= \\begin{cases} \\frac{u^n_{i}-u^n_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} &amp;a \\geq 0 \\\\ \\frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i}}{\\Delta x} &amp; a&lt;0 \\end{cases} \\] as a result: \\[ u^{n+1}_i = \\begin{cases} u^n_i - \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(u^n_{i}-u^n_{i-1} \\right) &amp;a \\geq 0 \\\\ u^n_i - \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i} \\right) &amp; a&lt;0 \\end{cases} \\] The idea is that because the downstream of the shock will not feel the upstream, so this upwind scheme may be able to capture this kind of discontinuity. Numerical practice Similarly, Euler in time, First Order Upwind in space is applied on the same problem (first_order_upwind.f90. And the result is shown below: This scheme is the best so far, there is no oscillation because it is first order the solution converge to the exact This scheme is slightly diffusive and the discontinuity is better captured with higher resolution. The location of the shock is well captured. Just for fun, we can apply the Lax-Friedrich in time and first order upwind in space, we still have the oscillations. It is explainable, maybe because the Lax-Friedrich's scheme breaks the intent of the linear upwind scheme to isolate upwind information. Lax-Wendroff scheme It is one of the most well known second order schemes, based on the Taylor's theorem for \\(u^{n+1}_i\\): \\[ u_{i}^{n+1} \\approx u_{i}^{n}+\\left.\\Delta t \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right|_{i} ^{n}+\\left.\\frac{\\Delta t^{2}}{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}}\\right|_{i} ^{n}+\\ldots \\] with \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -a\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = a^2\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\), plus the Euler scheme, we have: \\[ u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i}}{2} \\right) + \\frac{a^2\\Delta t^2}{\\Delta x^2}\\left(\\frac{u^n_{i+1}-2u^n_{i}+u^n_{i-1}}{2} \\right) \\] We know the original central space scheme creates the oscillations, and Lax-Wendroff decides to add an another second order derivative term. According to the NS equation, the second derivative acts like a viscous term, bringing the diffusion, so it might be able to stabilise the scheme.This scheme is not consistent, because of this additional second order term. Numerical practice Euler in time, Lax-Wendroff scheme in space is applied on the same problem (Lax-Wendroff.f90). And the result is shown below: This scheme, the oscillation area on the top grows with the resolution the solution converge to the exact The discontinuity is better captured with higher resolution. The location of the shock is well captured. The oscillated behaviour exist may be because the contribution of the stabiliser is too small. Try adding a coefficient to the second-order term, we have: \\[u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i}}{2} \\right) + \\phi \\frac{a^2\\Delta t^2}{\\Delta x^2}\\left(\\frac{u^n_{i+1}-2u^n_{i}+u^n_{i-1}}{2} \\right)\\] With code: Lax-Wendroff_coefficient.f90,It can be seen that increasing the value of \\(\\phi\\) brings more diffusion to the equation, and oppositely, increasing the number of nodes brings more oscillation to the system.The appropriate value of \\(\\phi\\) may be proportional to the mesh resolution. And actually it is also a function of the initial equation (the speed gap across the shock). In conclusion,First order scheme is diffusiveSecond order scheme is dispensiveFirst order solution is smooth / not accurate / stable (it is impossible for first order scheme to oscillate, it is the most used scheme in the industry when dealing with discontinuities)Second order solution is more accurate / oscillation (there is always more oscillations with more accurate solutions, more points, more values of the differences)The goal is to balance the accuracy with oscillation.Cancellation of oscillations is an active field of research Schemes on non-linear Burger equation After linear PDE, we consider a 1D non-linear case, burger equation, with two forms, primitive form: \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\] conservative form: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} = 0, \\\\ \\text{with }f(u)=\\frac{1}{2}u^2 \\end{aligned} \\] 1st order upwind scheme We consider forward difference (Euler) in time and 1st order upwind (backward in this case) in space, we have primitive form: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{u^{n+1}_{i}-u^{n}_{i}}{\\Delta t} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{u^{n+1}_{i}-u^{n}_{i}}{\\Delta x} \\end{aligned} \\] As a result: \\[ u^{n+1}_{i}= u^{n}_{i}-u^{n}_{i}\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(u^{n+1}_{i}-u^{n}_{i}\\right) \\] conservative form: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{u^{n+1}_{i}-u^{n}_{i}}{\\Delta t} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(u^{n+1}_{i})^2-(u^{n}_{i})^2}{2\\Delta x} \\end{aligned} \\] As a result: \\[ u^{n+1}_{i}= u^{n}_{i}-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\Delta x}\\left((u^{n+1}_{i})^2-(u^{n}_{i})^2\\right) \\] Numerical practice Consider a burger equation \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\] with a Riemann initial condition \\[ u(x, 0)= \\begin{cases} 1.2 &amp;x \\leq 0 \\\\ 0.4 &amp; x&gt;0\\end{cases} \\] Euler in time, first order upwind (backward in this case)scheme in space is applied on the same Riemann problem(). Set endtime as 2.5 to maintain the same shock position as before. And the result is shown below: As we can see: the non-conservative form failed to locate the shock position properly. Increase the resolution, the conservative form converges nicely. Conservative form performs better than the non-conservative, but the non-conservative form is alway easy to implement when dealing with the Euler equation. There is never a win-win situation. Conservative Form Schemes Now we know the conservative form is better, and here is a way of writing the scheme in the conservative form. First we need to go back the integral form with the finite volume methods. Finite-Volume Methods With the mesh above, we have the equation below, the change of cell values is only determined by the edge values. \\[ \\int_{x_{i-1 / 2}}^{x_{i+1 / 2}}\\left[u\\left(x, t^{n+1}\\right)-u\\left(x, t^{n}\\right)\\right] d x=-\\int_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}}\\left[f\\left(u\\left(x_{i+1 / 2}, t\\right)-f\\left(u\\left(x_{i-1 / 2}, t\\right)\\right)\\right] d t\\right. \\] Then define the cell-averaged \\(\\bar{u}_{i}^{n}\\) and \\(\\bar{u}_{i}^{n+1}\\) at time \\(t^{n}\\) and \\(t^{n+1}\\) : \\[ \\bar{u}_{i}^{n}=\\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{i-1 / 2}}^{x_{i+1 / 2}} u\\left(x, t^{n}\\right) d x \\quad \\bar{u}_{i}^{n+1}=\\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{i-1 / 2}}^{x_{i+1 / 2}} u\\left(x, t^{n+1}\\right) d x \\] plus the time averaged flux \\(f_{i-1 / 2}\\) and \\(f_{i+1 / 2}\\) as \\[ f_{i-1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}} f\\left(u\\left(x_{i-1 / 2}, t\\right)\\right) d t \\quad f_{i+1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}} f\\left(u\\left(x_{i+1 / 2}, t\\right)\\right) d t \\] We get the general form for a conservative numerical scheme: \\[ \\bar{u}_{i}^{n+1}=\\bar{u}_{i}^{n}-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left(f_{i+1 / 2}-f_{i-1 / 2}\\right) \\] We need consistency check as: for numerical flux \\(f_{i+1 / 2}\\): \\(f\\left(\\ldots, \\bar{u}_{i-1}, \\bar{u}_{i}, \\bar{u}_{i+1}, \\ldots\\right)=f(u)\\) for the conservative scheme: the velocity can only change due to the fluxes: we can easily have: \\[ (\\bar{u}_{i-1}^{n+1}+\\bar{u}_{i}^{n+1}+\\bar{u}_{i+1}^{n+1})=(\\bar{u}_{i}^{n-1}+\\bar{u}_{i}^{n}+\\bar{u}_{i}^{n+1})-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left(f_{i+3 / 2}-f_{i-3 / 2}\\right) \\] passed. Conservative Finite-Difference Methods Inspired by the FVM methods, we have the general form of a conservative FDM method: \\[ \\color{purple} \\bar{u}_{i}^{n+1}=\\bar{u}_{i}^{n}-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left(F^{n}_{i+1 / 2}-F^{n}_{i-1 / 2}\\right) \\] We can try to write the conservative version of most of the FDM methods, (but not all): Upwind method: \\[ F^{n}_{i+1 / 2} = \\frac{1}{2}(u^{n}_{i})^2 \\] Lax-Friedrich's scheme: \\[ F^{n}_{i+1 / 2} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\Delta t}(u^{n}_{i}-u^{n}_{i+1})+\\frac{1}{2}\\left[F(u^{n}_{i+1})+F(u^{n}_{i-1})\\right] \\] Some facts about conservative methods:Conservative methods automatically locate the shocks correctly (only the location, not the shape)Conservative methods may show large spurious oscillation and smoothing near shocksIf not strictly conservative, then incorrect shock speeds. One way to deal with is manually impose the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, with awareness of shock locations.Two main strategies for discontinuities,shock capturing (99%)Use a numerical scheme, in general conservative and with some added mechanism, to ensure that an entropy solution is obtained. (what we will discuss next)shock fittingShocks (and other discontinuities) are treated as internal boundaries and the jump conditions are imposed as compatibility conditions across them. Moreover, here is a theorem which is not very influential:Lax-Wendroff TheoremIf a consistent (numerical flux consistent with physical flux), conservative scheme for the numerical solution of a hyperbolic conservation law converges (as \\(\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0\\)), it converges to a weak solution.It's only a weak solution, not guarantee if it is physically acceptablenot guarantee it actually does converge Scheme on reverse Riemann problem So far our schemes only meet the Riemann problems with \\(u_L&gt;u_R\\), for the reverse problem, we consider the Burger equation with initial condition: \\[ u(x,0)= \\begin{cases} -1 &amp;x&lt;0 \\\\ 1 &amp; x&gt;0 \\end{cases} \\] We have two mathematical solutions as: Numerical schemes we set 2 different initial conditions: \\[ u_i^0= \\begin{cases} -1 &amp;i\\leq0 \\\\ 1 &amp; i&gt;0 \\end{cases} \\] \\[ u_i^0= \\begin{cases} -1 &amp;i&lt;0 \\\\ 0 &amp;i=0 \\\\ 1 &amp; i&gt;0 \\end{cases} \\] And use the first order upwind scheme as \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=\\frac{u_i^{n+1}-u_i^{n}}{\\Delta t}, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial (1/2u^2)}{\\partial x}= \\begin{cases} \\frac{(u_{i}^{n})^2-(u_{i-1}^{n})^2}{2\\Delta x} &amp;u_i^n\\geq0 \\\\ \\frac{(u_{i+1}^{n})^2-(u_i^{n})^2}{2\\Delta x} &amp; u_i^n&lt;0 \\end{cases} \\] Numerical Practice Solving the system with reverse_burger_first_order_upwind.f90, we have the result: As we can see a single change of the initial condition results in different solutions. conservative methods can converge to non-physical solutions rather than to the physically correct rarefaction wave. the solution is very sensitive to initial data. Actually it is also very sensitive the node number, and the CFL number, we change the nodes number to 100, keep the initial condition that converges to the entropy satisfying solution, we have another weak solution.Different node number i.e. mesh resolution result in different weak solutions. Two main findings:The code crashed at some node numbers.Two types of solutions are found, either almost align with the smooth former result, or presents a bumpy at the centre.The relationship between the node number and the type of the solutions possesses a bifurcation behaviours.I can't explain... Maybe still because the initial condition slightly changes with different resolutions. Need more work on searching more nodes numbers, and more initial condition settings.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fluid dynamics","slug":"fluid-dynamics","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/fluid-dynamics/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Compile OpenFOAM from source on M1 Mac","slug":"Build-OpenFOAM-from-source-on-M1-Mac","date":"2022-06-09T09:11:13.000Z","updated":"2022-06-09T10:20:51.879Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/06/09/Build-OpenFOAM-from-source-on-M1-Mac/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/06/09/Build-OpenFOAM-from-source-on-M1-Mac/","excerpt":"I just spent 3 hours building ESI OpenFOAM-v2112 from source code locally(no need docker) on my m1 MacBook air.

Abstract Despite the strength of traditional simulation methods, (FVM and FEM ...), the weakness still exist such as: Troublesome to deal with complex problems: mesh generation on complex boundary curse of dimensionality, high-dimensional problem Nearly impossible to exploit observations: incorporate available data (always noisy) seamlessly solve inverse problem* Obviously machine learning is designed to solve inverse problems with high dimensional data. Only problems are the requirement of big input data low interpretation Physics informed learning integrating these methods. The most attractive advantage is the ability to impose seamlessly physical law(constrains) on general machine learning model. With these constrains, the physical informed neural network will converge with much less data. And the interpretation can be improved as well. *Inverse problem: solving a problem from observations with part of knowledge of the mathematical model i.e. PDE. PINN still not belongs to fully Interpretable Neural Networks. Yet there is always a trade-off between interpretation and good performance.

Introduction Key idea The key points are learning from Dinky, Dirty, Dynamic, Deceptive data and Scientific domain knowledge e.g. physical principles, constrains, symmetries, computational simulations to develop a model that is: Accurate, Robust, Reliable, Interpretable, Explainable Instead of learning from the scratch, the developed valuable knowledge should also be exploited. prior knowledge stemming from our observational, empirical, physical or mathematical understanding of the world can be leveraged to improve the performance of a learning algorithm Data and Physics There are 3 scenarios when solving physical problems shown below: Forward problem Inverse problem System identification Physics based (complete PDE) Some physics(PDE, apart from BC, Initial, constants, params...) Physics free Data free Small/noisy data Data based FDM, FEM, FVM Multi-fidelity learning PINNDeepM&amp;Mnet NN Operator learning (DeepONet) Inverse problem is also called data assimilation problemSystem identification is also called model discovery The paper focus mostly on the last 2 scenarios and a lot of prior works are listed: Prior works 2. Method How to embed physics in ML There are 3 methods of imposing constrains into Neural Networks Observational biases Directly from data, same as general NN methods, there are examples such as refs[16][17][18] [19]. Techniques such as data augmentation can be useful. e.g., if some bias such as symmetry is known, symmetric data augmentation a good choice. Yet Difficult to find the symmetry and invariances. need big amount of data, which will cost a lot in most of the industrial areas. Inductive biases Embed the prior knowledge into architectures. e.g. CNNs possess translation invariance because of the \"convolution\" algorithm. Dirichlet BC below can be embedded such as: \\[ \\text{BC:} \\qquad u(0)=0, u(1)=1 \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} g(x)=x, \\ell(x)=x(1-x) \\\\ \\mathcal{N}(x)=g(x), \\quad x \\in \\Gamma_D \\subset \\Omega \\\\ \\hat{u}(x)=g(x)+\\ell(x) \\mathcal{N}(x) \\\\ \\begin{cases}\\ell(\\mathbf{x})=0, &amp; \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Gamma_D \\\\ \\ell(\\mathbf{x})&gt;0, &amp; \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega-\\Gamma_D\\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\] a carefully designed activation function is added after the last layer so that the output satisfies such conditions. For periodic boundary conditions, take the idea of Fourier series, add a Fourier layer after the input as shown: For divergence-free system, \\[ \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{f} = 0 \\] With the knowledge of \\[ \\text{divergence of the curl is 0: } \\quad \\nabla\\cdot (\\nabla\\times g) \\equiv 0 \\] choose: \\[ \\mathbf{f} = \\nabla \\times g \\] a \\(curl\\) function is added after the last layer so that the result is unconditionally divergence-free. It is nearly free, automatically and exactly. do it if possible designed case by case limited to relatively simple and well-posed physics require craftsmanship and elaborate implementations extension to more complex tasks is challenging Learning biases This is the most general method, the idea is tinkering/penalising the loss function modulate the training process Several examples include deep galerkin method[22], PINN and its extensions[23][24][25]. And PINN is mainly discussed. PINN is a highly flexible framework that allows one to incorporate more general instantiations of domain-specific knowledge into ML models. Besides, the backend NN can be changed into CNN and RNN. PINN method Example The method and paradigm of PINN can be illustrated via a typical example of solving a inverse problem: invisible cloaking design[26]. PINN is compatible with not only inverse problems, forward problems, operator learning are also in its scope. See DeepXDE demos. The title looks daunting but the problem is simple, relatively. As shown above, a constant electrical field \\(E_1\\) will be perturbed by a metal cylinder inside with a permittivity \\(\\epsilon_3\\). But this perturbation can be zero out by warping the cylinder with an extra \"coat\" with permittivity \\(\\epsilon_2\\). Goal: Given \\(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_3\\), solve \\(\\epsilon_2(x,y)\\) s.t. \\(E_1 = {E_{1}}_{org}\\) Physical system: Helmholtz equation \\(\\left(k_0=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda_0}\\right)\\) \\[ \\nabla^2 E_i+\\epsilon_i k_0^2 E_i=0, \\quad i=1,2,3 \\] Boundary conditions: Outer circle: \\(E_1=E_2, \\frac{1}{\\mu_1} \\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{n}}=\\frac{1}{\\mu_2} \\frac{\\partial E_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{n}}\\) Inner circle: \\(E_2=E_3, \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} \\frac{\\partial E_2}{\\partial \\mathrm{n}}=\\frac{1}{\\mu_3} \\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial \\mathrm{n}}\\) PINN architecture: We can design a PDE embedded MLP as input: \\(x, y\\) output: \\(E1,E2,E3,\\epsilon_2\\) loss function: blended function with observation loss and physical loss note that in PINN, the derivatives (e.g. \\(\\nabla\\) here) is calculated analytically by auto differentiation, no discretisation is needed, i.e. mesh-free &amp; particle free.In PINN, higher order auto differentiation could be needed in forward and back propagation (1 higher order than forward). In general NN, only 1st order derivative is calculated in the process of back propagation. Theory PINN: \\[ f\\left(\\mathbf{x} ; \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_d} ; \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_d} ; \\ldots ; \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}\\right)=0, \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega \\] Initial/boundary conditions \\(\\mathcal{B}(u, \\mathbf{x})=0\\) on \\(\\partial \\Omega\\) Extra information \\(\\mathcal{I}(u, \\mathbf{x})=0\\) for \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{T}_i\\) \\[ \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\mathcal{T})=w_f \\mathcal{L}_f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\mathcal{T}_f\\right)+w_b \\mathcal{L}_b\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\mathcal{T}_b\\right)+w_i \\mathcal{L}_i\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\mathcal{T}_i\\right) \\] where \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}_f &amp;=\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{T}_f\\right|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{T}_f}\\left\\|f\\left(\\mathbf{x} ; \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial x_1}, \\ldots ; \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_1}, \\ldots ; \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}\\right)\\right\\|_2^2 \\\\ \\mathcal{L}_b &amp;=\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{T}_b\\right|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{T}_b}\\|\\mathcal{B}(\\hat{u}, \\mathbf{x})\\|_2^2 \\\\ \\mathcal{L}_i &amp;=\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{T}_i\\right|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{T}_i}\\|\\mathcal{I}(\\hat{u}, \\mathbf{x})\\|_2^2 \\end{aligned} \\] Not surprisingly, the blending factors \\(w_f, w_b, w_i\\) needed to be tuned. Error analysis This section needs extra care. In my understanding, it says the classic theory says NN is dense only in first order, which is sufficient for general NN, not for PINN. Theorem (Universal approximation theorem; Cybenko, 1989)[31] Let \\(\\sigma\\) be any continuous sigmoidal function. Then finite sums of the form \\(G(x)=\\sum_{j=1}^N \\alpha_j \\sigma\\left(w_j \\cdot x+b_j\\right)\\) are dense in \\(C\\left(I_d\\right)\\).universal approximators: standard multilayer feedforward networks are capable of approximating any measurable function to any desired degree of accuracy Yet this theory has been extended to any higher order, which supports PINN well.

Merits of PINN Problem related merits: Flexible: Support different NN backends: MLP, CNN, RNN, GNN, GAN, Transformer etc... Support different disciplines: conservation laws, stochastic and fractional PDEs. Different problems effective on ill-posed inverse problem not effective on well-posed, no data needed forward problem Tackling high dimensionality unlike FVM/FDM or particles method, PINN is mesh free. So high dimensionality is not a problem. used to solve high-dimensional Black–Scholes, Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Allen–Cahn equations[30] Strong generalisation in small data regime Simple to implement in parallel Additional merits: Help understand deep learning provide theoretical insight and elucidate the inner mechanisms behind the surprising effectiveness of deep learning. Uncertainty quantification uncertainties include the physics, data, and learning models stochastic physical systems described by stochastic PDEs/ODEs GANs performs well on solving stochastic PDEs in high dimensions data: aleatoric uncertainty arising from the noise in data and epistemic uncertainty arising from the gaps in data Gaussian process regression (GPR) based PINN quantify uncertainty naturally, see ref[27] and its talk. Yet the scalability is low. (For NN, mini batch SGD can deal with big data.) An extension B-PINNs[29] can provide reasonable uncertainty bounds !Not fully understand, need knowledge of stochastic systems.So far I see data uncertainty quantification as a way of controlling overfitting and underfitting, i.e. bias and variance. (Recall underfitting - low bias and high variance, overfitting - high bias and low variance)Uncertainty in NNs can be partly quantified by techniques such as dropout, regularisation. 4. Applications Only fluid related works is presented here, more in the paper. Field inferring[33] The pressure and velocity can be inferred based on the temperature field. We know the N-S function, but the viscosity, boundary are not known. Field denoising[34] Similarly, if the input data is scattered and noisy, PINN is a method to construct the fluid field with a smooth and boundary-clear result. Other important fields (biomarkers) can be inferred seamlessly. 5. Limitations These limitations are also the treading research areas: Complex systems High-frequency components of multiscale systems high frequency is too much for MLP, the most common base of PINN extra tricks is needed computational complex on multiphysics system ref[3] based on DeepM&amp;M is a good example to deal with it loss function fail on specific problems traditional point-wise will fail on high-dimensional problems some special low-dimensional cases New algorithms and computational frameworks non-convex optimisation problems inherited from the Neural Networks global minim cannot be guaranteed refs[4][5][6] discuss more of it time consuming on tuning inherited from the Neural Networks autoML[7] techniques are emerging to solve this problem architecture teaching[8], meta-learning[9] etc transfer leaning popular idea in ML world ref[10] is a good attempting efficient higher order derivatives algorithms specific need for PINN, in general NN, only 1st order derivative is needed not well supported by mainstream ML frameworks (tf and torch) Taylor-mode automatic differentiation provides better support Database and benchmark supports UCI Machine Learning Repository[11] noise generated by an aerofoil ocean temperature and current measurements related to El Niño hydrodynamic resistance related to different yacht designs data is not available in many different applications standard benchmarks needed More mathematical understanding improve the understanding on NN and PINN improve the interpretation potential to more robust and effective training algorithms, build a solid foundation for NN and PINN 6. Outlooks Visualisation tool, need more of general TensorBoard, requirement to visualise the field solution on the fly, just like OpenFOAM. Potential of digital twins, several problems are pointed out: complexity of observations data: noisy, scarce, multi-modility need time consuming pre-processing and calibrations the control function always need extra constitutive laws to close Importance of building ML-based transformations between predictive models The normal paradigm need choose humanly interpretable observables/variables and a ‘reasonable’ dictionary of operators based on the chosen observables. Possibility to automatically determine variables physical model formulations. Active learning - data collection while training, determine what data to collect and what formulation to choose actively. Ultimately change the way of thinking. PINN family PINN has been a hit in science and math fields since its publish. Several following works are also published afterwards. Here are some of them: B-PINN[35] As mentioned before, unlike the Bayesian framework (e.g. GP), NN cannot provide uncertainty bounds. B-PINN integrate the Bayesian approach with PINN. When it comes to ill-posed problems and imperfect data, B-PINN is suitable. Yet prior for B-PINNs in a systematic way is still an open question. HPINN[36] Physics-informed neural networks with hard constraints (hPINNs). Recall the loss function of PINN, it is a blended function and each term cannot be perfectly satisfied (soft constraints). The Augmented Lagrangian method is used together with the loss function to make sure a hard constraints on the control function. FPINN[37] Origin PINN are suitable for integer-order partial differential equations (PDEs). FPINN extend the functions to Fractional Differential Equations. gPINN with RAR[38] Residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR[39]). Uniform residual points are not efficient for PDEs with steep solutions. RAR adaptively add more points in locations with large PDE residual. Gradient-enhanced PINN. Taking the idea that the derivatives of the PDE residual are also zero. gPINN embeds the gradient of the PDE residual into the loss. CPINN[40] and XPINN[41] Conservative physics-informed neural networks on discrete domains for conservation laws. The computational domain is decomposed and flux continuity is imposed in the strong form along the sub-domain interfaces. Enable PINN of parallelisation. eXtended PINNs: A generalised space-time domain decomposition based deep learning framework. Extend the conservation laws of CPINN to any type of PDEs. And the domain can be decomposed in any arbitrary way (in space and time, space and time parallelisation). Larger representation and parallelisation capacity, effective for multi-scale and multi-physics problems. References Karniadakis, G. E., Kevrekidis, I.

This is a series of brief notes for the popular lesson: Machine Learning for Fluid Mechanics, by Dr. Steve Brunton. He is not only a good instructor, but an active researcher focusing combining techniques in dimensionality reduction, sparse sensing, and machine learning for the data-driven discovery and control of complex dynamical systems. As we all know, computer vision is one major and advanced field of Machine learning. And the developed CV techniques can be leveraged directly to process fluid fields just by seeing them as images or movies. Some notable works as follows. Patterns exist This is the fundamental fact, even in the most complex systems, patterns exist. Just like there are dominant patterns (normally called latent features in the ML world) to define whether there is a human face or a dog in an image, there are dominant patterers to define a fluid field. Interesting facts: In 1987, Sirovich wrote two papers that pioneered in two fields. In April, he applied the PCA/SVD algorithm to human faces to generate the \"eigenfaces\" for face recognition[1]. Later in October, he applied this same technique into fluid fields to extract the coherent structures of flow fields[2]. POD/PCA and Autoencoder Background POD: Given a complex fluid field sequence such as the von Kármán vortex street, one can tell there's a simple regular pattern emerging here even if it has lots of pixels or generated by a sophisticate simulation with large degree of freedom. The patterns can be extracted by simple tools in linear algebra. For example, subtracting off the mean flow then deploying a singular vector decomposition to get a POD expansion as: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\approx \\bar{\\mathbf{u}} + \\sum^r_{k=1}\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_k(x)\\mathbf{a}_k(t) \\] It writes the spatial-temporal flow field as the mean flow plus the summation of several static eigenflow fields. And the eigen vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) changes with time enabling the summation also a function of time \\(t\\). POD method has been developed for 50 years and it is a cornerstone on how to analysis complex flow fields. Note that this can be seen as a special form of the Fourier decomposition, space-time separation of variables. Fourier transform are very useful to decompose space-time variables and POD is a data-driven generalisation of the Fourier transform that satisfies the particular fluid boundary conditions and is generated form physical data of an actual flow simulation. Autoencoder: In this modern era, the POD/PCA can be rewritten in the form of the neural network as shown above. It works as a bottom neck information filter where the encoder compress the complex data into a latent space and the decoder reconstructs the full flow field image. And the objective is to minimise the distance between the reconstructed image and the original image. And by constraining the hidden layer size as much as possible, the encoder is able to distill the most important fluid coherent structure for reconstruction of the flow field image. Deep Autoencoder: Now a deep autoencoder with more hidden layers with non-linear activation functions can be deployed to enhance the performance i.e. smaller latent space in the middle, better coordinate representations of the flow field, and simpler representations to work with downstream tasks. Example Michele Milano and Petros Koumoutsakos are the first to introduce AE into fluid dynamic. They applied neural network modelling for near wall turbulent flow[3], and compared with POD results, 2 decades ahead of its time. Robust PCA Following the above work, lots of things can be done such as robustify the extraction of patterns, on noisy data, corrupted data or data with outliers. Background PIV: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an experimental technique to measure the fluid non-invasively. And the flow field tend to become highly noisy with higher speed and larger window. RPCA: While in the field of the image science, Candès et.al[6] suggests the principal components of data can be recovered even if part of the data is arbitrarily corrupted. They describes the corrupted data as a superposition of a Low rank component \\(L_0\\) and a sparse component \\(S_0\\), and the robust PCA is presented to recover each components. They also deploy the RPCA to recover the main characters from the background in surveillance videos and remove the shadows and specialities in faces images (as shown above). Why not apply it into the fluid flow images? PIV uses the cross-correlation algorithm[4] to determine the displacement of each sub-window. This is the exact same algorithm used in the CNNs. However, they call it \"convolution\"[5], regardless of the fact that the actual convolution method is the transposition of the cross-correlation algorithm. Example: Isabel Scherl et.al[7] apply the RPCA algorithm to recover the the salt pepper corrupted flow fields, by solving a ralated relaxed optimisation problem. The low rank and sparse component refer to the coherent structure and the noise. And the POD and DMD modes separated from the recovered data can be highly optimised as well. Super resolution Background Super resolution is already a mature field in image sciences, and it can be directly deployed into flow fields. Example Above is the result of reconstructing the turbulence flow fields(Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database) from the coarse results obtained by applying an average pooling on the original flow fields[3]. Multiple MLPs are deployed for this task. Yet the good results only happen at the interpolation scenario, for the extrapolation i.e. prediction task, the reconstruction failed. More physics need to add to make this work. Compared with the flow field prediction, all the CV tasks with large pretrained models are interpolation tasks. The training data already contains all the data that needed. Statistical stationarity In stead of a simple flow passed a cylinder, most fluid fields in the real life are more complicated. It brings more difficulties for models to reconstruct the fluid. Example Callaham, J. L et.al [9] apply robust flow reconstruction via sparse representation on flow pass a cylinder, mixing layer, sea surface temperature and gulf of Mexico. And the modes needed to reconstruct each flow fields increase as shown above. This article mainly shows the sparse model outperforms the general model. But in the discussion session, it brings up the key requirements of the reconstruction: sufficient training data and sufficient measured information. And they quantify the rate of sufficiency in each cases. The residuals of projecting test data onto the linear subspaces of POD modes of increasing training data is provided. As more data is added to the training set, test set are more likely to be generalised by the training data modes. Personally, I don't really understand the term projection. Whether it is same as reconstruction but in an opposite direction? Need more knowledge on it. For flow pass a cylinder, the model performs well even with very few training data since the flow is simple and periodic. However, the mixing layer and Gulf of Mexico vorticity data have relatively large residual, indicating that there are still new structures that haven’t been observed in the training data. Above compares the normalised residual error of sparse representation-based reconstructions with increasing number of random point measurements. Similar to the research on amount of the training data, more information is needed from measurements to reconstruct a more complicate flow field. The result might be better if a powerful reconstruction model is used such as the Deep Autoencoder. It is still an open area. Reference Sirovich, L., &amp; Kirby, M. (1987).

He is not only a good instructor, but an active researcher focusing combining techniques in dimensionality reduction, sparse sensing, and machine learning for the data-driven discovery and control of complex dynamical systems. Given the background of the popularity of ML in the CV area, this lesson focus on how to apply it into the field of traditional physics science and engineering, especially dynamical systems and fluid mechanics. Introduction Several Q&amp;As: Explain machine learning in nutshell. Machine learning is a growing set of techniques for high dimensional, non-convex optimisations based on a growing wealth of data. Why machine learning suits fluid mechanics? Almost all of the fluid dynamics tasks (including Reduction, modelling, control, sensing and closure) can be written as nonlinear, non-convex, multi-scale and very high dimensional (very hard) optimisation problems that can't be solved efficiently by traditional methods. Yet it is exactly the field of machine learning. What is high dimensional? Fluid itself has many degrees of freedom, million or billion degrees of freedom might be needed for simulate a turbulent fluid. And a growing of data leads an explosion of dimension. What is non-linear? Because fluids is governed by a nonlinear PDE, the NS equation. What is non-convex? Because there exists local minima in the optimisation problems. What kind of ML do we need? Interpretable, generalisable i.e. reliable Sparse, low-dimensional, robust History Machine learning and fluid dynamics share a long history of interfaces. Pioneered by Rechenberg (1973) and Schwefel (1977), who introduced Evolution Strategies (ES) to design and optimise the profile of a multi-panel plate in order to minimise the drag. The stochastic was introduced and a optimisation similar to the SGD is applied to find the best configuration. Another link is Sir James Lighthill's report (1974), which leads the AI winter. His report says AI fails to meet the promises in several fields, such as speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). The first time I heard this part of history, I thought this Lighthill was some idiot who lacks insight. I never connected this man with the very person who proposed the Lighthill's Equation with the acoustic analogy method and founded the subject of aeroacoustics, during his PHD!Also, it reminds me a talk I saw by Geoffrey Hinton, who said he came to the US because he couldn't find a job in the UK with a degree in AI. Back then (1978) UK refused to fund almost any research topics related to AI and deep learning, partly of Sir Lighthill's consequences.It's just like someone of my field narrowly buried the AI halfway yet at the same time influenced a star in this area. Examples POD/PCA/SVA POD refers to the PCA done on the flow data. With a series of snapshots of a flow past a cylinder at \\(Re\\approx100\\), subtracting the mean flow and applying a singular value decomposition (SVA), the resulting dominant eigen flows (modes, representing the flow patterns) can be used to construct a reduced order model to reproduce the fluid flow field efficiently. One application of this method is shown below[1], RPCA, a variant of PCA is applied to denoise the artificially pepper-salt corrupted DNS simulation result, and real PIV experiment result. The outliers and the true fluid field are able to separate with a change of the \\(\\lambda\\). Closure modelling This is a DNS simulation on turbulent boundary layers by HTL. As we zoom in and out, massive fractal, multi-scale patterns are found in space and time. This happens everytime and everywhere when fluid flowing past a wing, car, or inside an engine. But instead of simulating the full DNS equation i.e. resolving the patterns with all the energy scales, we only want to get a reduced order model approximating the small energy scales while focusing on only the scales of energy that resulting in the macroscopic change of the fluid. Steve reckons this as the one of the most exciting area where ML can really make a practical impact on everyday industrials. And I heard that after a talk in China, he said a great progress on the area of turbulence might be made in the next 2 decades. (I'm not sure, just heard of it) One inspiring job[2] is mentioned which study the RANs closure models. They designed a novel customised structure that embed the physical variables one layer before the output layer of NN. And it inspires us how to \"bake in\" prior knowledge to design a model not only accurate but also physically meaningful\". Super resolution Super resolution is already a mature field in image sciences, and it can be directly deployed into flow fields. Above is the result of reconstructing the turbulence flow fields(Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database) from the coarse results obtained by applying an average pooling on the original flow fields[3]. Multiple MLPs are deployed for this task. Yet the good results only happen at the interpolation scenario, for the extrapolation i.e. prediction task, the reconstruction failed. More physics need to add to make this work. Deep autoencoders The classical POD/PCA can be written in a form of one-layer linear autoencoder. And instead solving by the analytic SVD algorithm, it can be solved by SGD. So why not change the two-layer, linear autoencoder into the non-linear, multilayer deep autoencoder? Based on this thought, Michele Milano and Petros Koumoutsakos deployed neural network modeling for near wall turbulent flow[4], and compared with POD results, 2 decades ahead of its time. This concepts are also developed to build the reduced order models. The pattens extracted from POD or AE can be used to build simple representations in a low dimensional coordinate. For example Bernd R. Noack et als' work[5] showed the dynamics of transient cylinder wakes can be concluded by a hierarchy of low-dimensional models lived on parabolic bowls. And these learned coordinates can be used with data-diven methods like SINDy(the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics)[6] to build efficient models for predicting the modes purely from measurement data. Jean-Christophe Loiseau has done a lot work based on this[7]. The ultimate goal: Flow control It is a very principled optimisation of the flow field and of the control law with some objectives in mind. Those objectives come from the real wold such as: increasing the lift, decreasing the drag. And these optimisation problems can be solved better with machine learning tools. As shown by Bieker at als' diagram[8], instead of controlling a NS equation, an efficient alternative is controlling a machine learning surrogate model to realise the real-time control. Inspiration from biology At last to give us some confidence, Steve mentioned without knowing the NS equations, eagle can somehow manoeuvre the complex turbulence flow by its own sensors on its wings. And the insects, with way small neural system, they can handle the complex turbulence flow elegantly and seamlessly (I don't feel any self-confidence hearing this). And maybe we can learn something from them and fit into our engineering world. Scherl, I., Strom, B., Shang, J. K., Williams, O., Polagye, B. L., &amp; Brunton, S. L. (2020).

The resulting boundary layers and wakes are responsible for generating forces and moments on the obstacle. 4.1 Examples 4.1.1 Lift generation Here comes the most popular question: how does an aircraft fly? The basic answer is that The airfoil is shaped so that its upper surface is longer than its lower surface. A parcel of fluid arriving at the leading edge then splits into two parcels, one following the upper surface and the other the lower surface. As the fluid has more distance to travel on the upper surface than on the lower surface, it goes faster to have the same transit time. The Bernoulli effect follows: the higher velocity on the upper surface yields a lower pressure and an ascending force is created: the lift. The use of Bernoulli effect is, to some extent, correct. However, based on experiment findings shown below, the same transit time assumption is not quite right. I{t}s clear the upper flow is accelerated compared to the lower flow. This happens already at the leading edge, but the lower flow never catches up with the upper one. As a result, the upper flow possesses a shorter transit time. As a consequence, the physical mechanism behind lift is not so simple. A plausible answer is twofolds. On the one hand, the fluid is accelerated on the upper surface and slowed down on the lower surface, creating a descending pressure gradient, hence lift. On the other hand, the fluid trajectory is overall deflected downwards when passing the airfoil. This implies that the airfoil creates a descending force onto the fluid, and, by Newton’s third law, that the fluid generates an ascending force onto the airfoil. 4.1.2 Wingtip vortices At the tip of the wing, when the lower pressure upper surface meets the higher pressure lower surface, wingtip vortices are generated. These vortices are generally strong, long-lived and consequently dangerous, as shown below: Flying through such a vortex will create a rolling moment that can destabilize the flight. Many such incidents have happened during takeoff and landing. As a result, airports have decided on quiet periods of one to two minutes between two successive takeoffs or landings to allow for these vortices to dissipate to a less dangerous strength. Yet the wingtip vortices are leveraged perfectly by the nature, the V-formation. When one bird follows another bird, it places itself a little bit on the side to benefit from the lift generated by the wingtip vortices of its leader. 4.1.3 Others Wind and ocean engineering also present important challenges in the area of fluid-structure interaction. The construction of tall building is necessary to accommodate large professional centres and these tall buildings interact strongly with the wind. Similar issues arise with bridges. Serious oscillation would be generated due to the \"wind load\". In water, it is important to understand fluid-structure interactions to design efficient breakwaters and protect constructions on the shore or beaches. Pier piles are also good examples of structures interacting with water and that have to be designed carefully. Lastly, we can take advantage of natural phenomena such as wind and currents by designing structures that will store such energy like wind and water turbines. 4.2 Effect of a structure on the fluid When an external flow goes past an obstacle, boundary layer and wake effects occur on the walls and after the obstacle respectively. 4.2.1 Boundary layers Convenient definition: a region where the fluid’s velocity parallel to the wall is smaller or equal to 99% of the external velocity. Inside the boundary layer, the flow feels the effect of the wall and is gradually slowed down as we approach the wall. The presence of these velocity gradients is a consequence of viscous dissipation. Outside the boundary layer, the flow does not feel the presence of the walls. It remains homogeneous and is considered inviscid. Note that this is only an assumption, the interaction between the boundary layer and the outer pressure distribution is neglected. For slender bodies at large \\(Re\\), such as airfoils, when placed parallel to the flow, this assumption provides good results due to the thin and weak boundary layer. There are two types of the boundary layers defined by the Reynolds number: Low \\(Re\\), laminar boundary layer. Because spatial variations are slow, the laminar boundary layer occupies a large spatial region. High \\(Re\\), two distinct regions in the boundary layer: laminar boundary layer similar to that of low-Re flows but much thinner turbulent boundary layer that occurs further away in the streamwise direction and is larger than the laminar boundary layer. The viscous displacement effect describes the non-zero velocity in the direction orthogonal to the wall because the velocity parallel to the wall varies in the direction orthogonal to the wall. For low \\(Re\\) laminar boundary layers, this effect is important For high \\(Re\\) boundary layers, these boundary layers are so thin that this effect is negligible. 4.2.2 Wakes When the inertia is non-trivial (equivalently viscous effects are not overwhelmingly dominant), the gradients of velocity induced by the boundary layer are advected downstream and create a wake past the obstacle. This region can display dramatic departures from the established flow infinitely far away from the obstacle. The sketch above shows how several typical regimes of the wake past a cylinder in different \\(Re\\)s: Low \\(Re\\): steady and symmetric flow \\(Re=\\mathcal{O}(10)\\): the upstream-downstream symmetry is broken flow separation occurs. The boundary layers separate from the wall and a recirculation zone is created where two counter-rotating vortices live. wake remains stationary the up-down symmetry is still preserved \\(Re=\\mathcal{O}(100)\\): the up-down symmetry is broken flow separation developed wake is now periodic in time, vortices periodically break away from the back of the cylinder in an alternate fashion and are advected downstream This type of wake is called Von Kármán streets. \\(Re&gt;\\mathcal{O}(1000)\\): any simple time-dependence in the wake is lost and it is now turbulent. Note that as the Reynolds number is increased, different types of turbulent wakes can be observed. At \\(Re = 5\\times10^3\\), the turbulent wake is detached from the wall and a laminar bubble is observed at the back of the cylinder. As the Reynolds number is increased, this bubble shrinks At \\(Re = 10^5\\), the back of the cylinder has become fully turbulent As Re is further increased, the turbulent wake becomes thinner and thinner and the influence of the cylinder on the flow decreases. This is the result of the fact that the characteristic length for advection becomes incomparably larger than the diameter of the cylinder 4.3 Effect of the fluid on a structure In this section, we look at the opposite interaction: the impact of boundary layers and wakes on the structures. 4.3.1 Free kick like Cristiano Ronaldo Personally, I'm not a big fan of football. The only football game I watch is FIFA. And I happened to watch this legendary game on live. I remember it was 3 o'clock in the morning and I barely held my scream. The explanation of such a trajectory lies in the Magnus effect which describes a spinning object moving through a fluid. Rotating the ball accelerates the flow on one side while slowing it down on the other. This difference of velocity breaks the symmetry of the flow and creates a difference of pressure. And this results in an additional force that bends the trajectory of the ball. 4.3.2 The Tacoma Narrows bridge Another famous aeroelastic failure is this 1.8km long bridge in the state of Washington. The 6 million dollar bridge collapsed in a steady standard wind in November, 1940, only 3 months after its opening date. Back then this wind interacted in an unexpected manner with the bridge and created a positive feedback loop called aeroelastic flutter. A oscillating wake due to the periodic vortex shedding excited a second torsional mode: the midpoint of the bridge remained motionless while the two opposite halves twisted in opposite directions. This torsion further enhanced the strength of the wake, which in turn enhanced the torsion until the bridge collapsed. 5 Boundary layer theory – Integral approach First, a control volume is defined as blow: Boundary ①: the segment \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((0, h)\\), where \\(\\mathbf{u} = U\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}\\). Boundary ②: the streamline \\((0, h)\\) to \\((L, \\delta)\\), where \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0\\). Boundary ③: the segment \\((L, \\delta)\\) to \\((L, 0)\\), where $ = u(x, y) + v(x, y)$. Boundary ④: the plate surface and streamline \\((L, 0)\\) to \\((0, 0)\\), where \\(u = 0\\). 5.1 Viscous displacement 5.1.1 Physical origin The viscous displacement determines the upstream streamlines parallel to the wall to move away from the wall i.e. boundary ② to tilt upward. It can be explained by the 2D compressible continuity equation: \\[ \\partial_x u+\\partial_y v=0 \\] Near the boundary ③, the no-slip condition gives \\(\\partial_xu&lt;0\\), to compensate for it, \\(\\partial_yv&gt;0\\), and the consequence of this is the viscous displacement. 5.1.2 Displacement thickness The quantity \\(\\delta^*\\) is called displacement thickness and represents the distance by which the wall would have to be moved in the wall normal direction to obtain the same flow rate in an inviscid flow. i.e. the additional blockage/deflection due to viscosity. By definition, it is easy to conclude that \\(\\delta = \\delta^*+h\\). And by mass conservation between the inlet and the outlet, the displacement thickness can be described: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\rho\\int_1(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})ds&amp;+\\rho\\int_3(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})ds =0 \\\\ \\int^{\\delta-\\delta^*}_0(-U&amp;)dy+\\int^\\delta_0udy=0 \\\\ Uh&amp;= \\int^\\delta_0udy \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Substitute \\(h\\) with \\(\\delta-\\delta^*\\) : \\[ \\begin{aligned} U(\\delta-\\delta^*) &amp;= \\int^\\delta_0udy \\\\ U(\\delta-\\delta^*) &amp;= \\int^\\delta_0\\left(u+U-U\\right)dy \\\\ U(\\delta-\\delta^*) &amp;= U\\delta+\\int^\\delta_0\\left(u-U\\right)dy \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad\\delta^* = \\int_0^\\delta&amp;\\left(1-\\frac uU\\right)dy\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad\\color{purple}{\\frac{\\delta^*}{\\delta} = \\int_0^1}&amp;\\color{purple}{\\left(1-\\frac uU\\right)d\\eta}, \\quad\\mathrm{where~}\\eta=\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 5.2 Friction drag 5.2.1 Drag as a boundary layer effect Assume a constant pressure throughout the domain, and a steady flow. The conservation of momentum in \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}\\) writes: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\rho\\int_1u(0,y)(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})ds + \\underbrace{\\rho\\int_2u(x,y)(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})ds+}_{\\mathrm{streamline:~}\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}=0} ...\\\\ \\rho\\int_3u(L,y)(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})ds+ \\underbrace{\\rho\\int_4u(x,0)(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})ds}_{\\mathrm{wall:~}u=0}= \\Sigma F_x = -D\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} \\end{aligned} \\] The equation simplifies into: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\rho\\int_0^hU(-U)dy + \\rho\\int_0^\\delta u^2dy=-D \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad D = \\rho hU^2 -\\rho\\int_0^\\delta u^2dy \\end{aligned} \\] Combine with the mass conservation result \\(Uh= \\int^\\delta_0udy\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} D &amp;= \\rho \\int_0^\\delta Uudy-\\rho\\int_0^\\delta u^2dy \\\\ \\color{purple}{D }&amp;\\color{purple}{= \\rho \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{u}{U}\\left(1-\\frac{u}{U}\\right) dy} \\end{aligned} \\] 5.2.2 Momentum thickness The quantity \\(\\theta\\) is called momentum thickness and represents the distance by which the wall would have to be moved in the wall normal direction to obtain the same momentum in an inviscid flow. \\[ \\color{purple}\\frac{\\theta}{\\delta} = \\frac{D}{\\rho U^2\\delta} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u}{U}\\left(1-\\frac{u}{U}\\right) d\\eta, \\quad \\mathrm{where~}\\eta = \\frac{y}{\\delta} \\] i.e. the momentum deficit can be determined by: \\[ \\rho U^2\\theta = \\rho \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{u}{U}\\left(1-\\frac{u}{U}\\right)dy \\] There is another Energy thickness writes: \\[\\color{purple}\\frac{\\theta&#39;}{\\delta} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u}{U}\\left(1-\\frac{u^2}{U^2}\\right) d\\eta, \\quad \\mathrm{where~}\\eta = \\frac{y}{\\delta}\\] We can then define the shape factor: \\[ H = \\frac{\\delta^*}{\\theta} \\] Shape factor indicates the wall-normal distance on which the fluid is deflected from the plate compared to that on which gradients of streamwise velocities are felt.A large shape factor indicates a flow near separation. 5.2.3 Relation to wall shear stress The drag force is the integration of wall shear stress \\(\\tau_w\\) along the plate: \\[ D = \\int_0^L\\tau_wdx \\] Or in differential form: \\[ \\tau_w = \\partial_xD \\] Differentiate the momentum thickness representation: \\[ \\partial_x\\theta = \\frac{\\partial_xD}{\\rho U^2}=\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho U^2} \\] As a result, the wall shear: \\[ \\color{purple}\\tau_w = \\rho U^2\\partial_x\\theta \\] 5.3 Velocity profile approximations For laminar boundary layers, Von Kármán assumed that the velocity profile (\\(\\frac{u}{U}\\)) within the boundary layer had a parabolic shape: Given: \\[ \\eta = \\frac{y}{\\delta(x)} \\] The velocity profile (\\(\\frac{u}{U}\\)) writes: \\[ \\frac{u}{U}\\approx 2\\eta -\\eta^2, \\qquad 0\\leq \\eta\\leq 1 \\] For turbulent boundary layers, Prandtl highlighted a one-seventh power velocity profile: \\[ \\frac{u}{U}\\approx\\eta^\\frac{1}{7}, \\qquad 0\\leq \\eta\\leq 1 \\] These first order approximations are very close to the reality as shown below: 5.4 Laminar results (Von Kármán results) Based on Von Kármán's approximation, \\(\\frac{u}{U}\\approx \\frac{2y}{\\delta} -\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)^2\\). It is easy to get: Boundary thickness: The key point is that the wall shear stress can be expressed in two ways, by definition: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\tau_w &amp;= \\mu \\partial_yu|_{y=0} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad \\tau_{w} &amp;\\approx \\mu \\partial_{y}\\left.\\left(\\frac{2 y}{\\delta}-\\frac{y^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}\\right)\\right|_{y=0} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad \\tau_{w} &amp;\\approx \\mu \\frac{2 U}{\\delta}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] and by the derivative of drag: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\tau_w &amp;= \\rho U^2\\partial_x\\theta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad \\tau_{w} &amp;\\approx \\rho U^2\\partial_x\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\delta}\\left(\\frac{2 y}{\\delta}-\\frac{y^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{2 y}{\\delta}+\\frac{y^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}\\right) d y \\right] \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad \\tau_{w} &amp;\\approx \\frac{2\\rho U^2}{15}\\partial_x\\delta \\end{aligned} \\] As a result, connect these expressions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\mu \\frac{2 U}{\\delta} \\approx \\frac{2\\rho U^2}{15}\\partial_x\\delta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp;\\int_0^x dx \\approx \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{\\rho U}{15}\\delta d\\delta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp;x \\approx \\frac{\\rho U \\delta^2}{30\\mu} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp; \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{x}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{30\\mu}{\\rho U x} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp; \\color{purple}{\\frac{\\delta}{x} \\approx 5.5 Re_x^{-1/2}} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\color{purple}Re_x= Ux/\\nu\\) as the streamwise Reynold. the displacement thickness: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\delta^* &amp;= \\int_0^\\delta\\left(1-\\frac{u}{U}\\right)dy \\\\ &amp;\\approx \\int_0^\\delta\\left(1-\\frac{2y}{\\delta}+\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)^2\\right)dy \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad \\delta^*&amp;\\approx \\frac{1}{3}\\delta\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] with the boundary thickness expression: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\color{purple}\\frac{\\delta^*}{x}\\approx 1.83 Re_x^{-1/2} \\end{aligned} \\] the momentum displacement and the factor of friction: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\theta &amp;= \\int_{0}^{\\delta}\\left(\\frac{2 y}{\\delta}-\\frac{y^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{2 y}{\\delta}+\\frac{y^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}\\right) d y \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp; \\theta \\approx \\frac{2}{15}\\delta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp; \\color{purple}{\\frac{\\theta}{x} \\approx 0.73 Re_x^{-1/2}} \\end{aligned} \\] The factor of friction has the same order with the momentum displacement, as \\[ \\color{purple}{C_f \\approx 0.73 Re_x^{-1/2}} \\] the shape factor: \\[ \\color{purple} H = \\frac{\\delta^*}{\\theta} \\approx 2.5 \\] 5.5 Laminar results (Blasius results) Reference to MIT's note, MECH 346 – Heat Transfer's Youtube channel 5.5.1 Governing equations Conditions: 2D Steady Incompressible Neglect viscous dissipation, gravity and thermal dissipation Plus the thin layer assumption (\\(L\\gg\\delta\\)) for boundary layer (Obtained by non-dimensional scaling analysis, Full deriving on Appendix A.1): \\[ \\begin{aligned} u&amp;\\gg v \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&amp;\\gg\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\end{aligned} \\] The mass and momentum conservation equations reduces to: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} &amp;= 0 \\\\ u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}&amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}+ \\nu\\left(\\overbrace{\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2}}^{\\mathrm{0}}+\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2}\\right) \\\\ u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}&amp;= \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}}_{\\text{principle order}}+\\nu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2v}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2v}{\\partial y^2}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] as a result: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} &amp;= 0 \\\\ u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}&amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}+\\nu\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}&amp;=0 \\end{aligned} \\] For the flat plate boundary layer, it is easy to get \\(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}=0\\) because the free stream pressure gradient in the \\(x\\) direction is \\(0\\), so as in the boundary layer given the \\(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}=0\\). As a consequence there is no pressure gradient within the flat plate boundary layer. The final governing equation writes: \\[ \\color{purple} \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} &amp;= 0 \\\\ u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}&amp;=\\nu\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] And the boundary conditions are: \\[ \\color{purple} \\begin{aligned} u=v = 0\\quad&amp;\\mathrm{at}\\quad y = 0\\\\ u = U\\quad&amp;\\mathrm{at}\\quad x = 0 \\\\ u \\rightarrow U\\quad&amp;\\mathrm{as}\\quad y \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] These conditions demand an infinite gradient in speed at the leading edge \\(x = y = 0\\), which implies a singularity in the mathematical solution there. The solution given by the boundary layer approximation is not valid at the leading edge.

In contrast to the most frequently used method of \"separation variables\", the similarity solution involves combining the variables in a special way. Another example of using similarity to solve Heat diffusion equation lies on the Appendix A.2. A self-similar equation doesn't change regardless how the variables scale. So assume a transformation: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y = \\lambda^a\\bar{y}\\\\ x = \\lambda^b\\bar{x}\\\\ \\psi = \\lambda^c\\bar{\\psi}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The resulting scaled function and writes: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\lambda^{3c-2a-b}\\frac{\\partial\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}} \\frac{\\partial^2\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{x} \\partial \\bar{y}}- \\lambda^{3c-2a-b}\\frac{\\partial\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{x}} \\frac{\\partial^2\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}^2} = \\lambda^{3c-3a}\\nu\\frac{\\partial^3\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}^3} \\\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\quad\\frac{\\partial\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}} \\frac{\\partial^2\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{x} \\partial \\bar{y}}- \\frac{\\partial\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{x}} \\frac{\\partial^2\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}^2} = \\lambda^{-3c-a+b}\\nu\\frac{\\partial^3\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}^3} \\end{aligned} \\] And the scaled boundary conditions gives: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\lambda^{c-a}\\frac{\\partial\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{y}}=\\lambda^{c-b}\\frac{\\partial\\bar{\\psi}}{\\partial \\bar{x}} = 0\\quad&amp;\\mathrm{at}\\quad \\lambda^{a}\\bar{y} = 0\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] As a result, all the powers should be 0: \\[ \\left.\\begin{array}{c} \\left.\\begin{array}{c} -c-a+b=0 \\\\ c-a=0 \\end{array}\\right\\} \\quad b=a / 2 \\\\ c-b=0 \\qquad \\qquad \\quad \\end{array}\\quad\\right\\} \\quad c=a / 2 \\] Here I need to put my derivation here: Similar to Appendix A.2, we can construct an expression of \\(\\psi\\) as: \\[ \\psi(x,y)= x^{1/2}f^\\dagger(\\eta^\\dagger), \\quad \\eta^\\dagger = yx^{-1/2} \\] Personal comment: I still don't know how to construct this kinda thing or why it work. The formula in Appendix gives me some idea but following it I got \\(\\psi(x,y)= x^{1}f^\\dagger(\\eta^\\dagger)\\), \\(\\eta^\\dagger = yx^{-1/2}\\) instead... Substitute the expression of \\(\\psi\\) into the equation with \\(f^{\\dagger&#39;} = \\partial_{\\eta^{\\dagger}}f^{\\dagger}\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y} &amp;= f^{\\dagger&#39;} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} &amp;= x^{-1/2}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^3\\psi}{\\partial y^3}&amp;= x^{-1}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;&#39;}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}f^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1}f^{\\dagger&#39;}y \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}(f^{\\dagger} -\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;}) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y} &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}(x^{-1/2}f^{\\dagger&#39;} -x^{-1/2}\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;} - x^{-1/2}f^{\\dagger&#39;}) \\\\ &amp;=-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1}\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y} &amp;= f^{\\dagger&#39;}\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1}\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;}\\right] \\\\ &amp;= -\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1} \\eta^{\\dagger}f^{\\dagger&#39;}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;} \\\\ -\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} &amp;=\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}(f^{\\dagger} -\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;})\\left[x^{-1/2}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;}\\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1}(f^{\\dagger} +\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;})f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] As a result: \\[ \\begin{aligned} -\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1}\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;}+ \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1}(f^{\\dagger} &amp;+\\eta^{\\dagger} f^{\\dagger&#39;})f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;} = \\nu x^{-1}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;&#39;}\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\qquad \\nu f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;&#39;} - &amp;\\frac{1}{2} f^{\\dagger}f^{\\dagger&#39;&#39;} = 0 \\end{aligned} \\] Ok.. above is what I derived, it's still an ODE but normally we want a cleaner result. So Blasius construct \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\eta\\) with physical meaningful non-dimensional parameters to get (reference to MECH 346 – Heat Transfer's Youtube channel): \\[ \\color{purple} \\psi(x,y)= (\\nu Ux)^{1/2}f(\\eta), \\quad \\eta = \\left(\\frac{U}{\\nu x}\\right)^{1/2}y \\] So that: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}}y,&amp; \\quad\\mathrm{dimensionless~wall~normal~coordinate}\\\\ f = \\frac{\\psi}{\\sqrt{\\nu Ux}},&amp; \\quad\\mathrm{dimensionless~stream~function}\\\\ f&#39; = \\frac{u}{U},&amp; \\quad\\mathrm{dimensionless~velocity~profile} \\\\ f&#39;&#39; = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu Ux}}{U^2}\\partial_yu, &amp;\\quad\\mathrm{related~to~shear~stress} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] And terms of the governing equation becomes: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y} &amp;= Uf&#39; \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} &amp;= {(U\\nu x)}^{-1/2}f&#39;&#39; \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^3\\psi}{\\partial y^3}&amp;= U^2x^{-1}f&#39;&#39;&#39;\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(\\nu U/x)^{1/2}(f -\\eta f&#39;)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y} &amp;=-\\frac{1}{2}Ux^{-1}\\eta f&#39;&#39; \\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y} &amp;= -\\frac{1}{2}U^2x^{-1}\\eta f&#39;f&#39;&#39;\\\\ -\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}U^2x^{-1}(f +\\eta f&#39;)f&#39;&#39;\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] And the ODE turns out to be: \\[ \\color{purple} 2f&#39;&#39;&#39; +ff&#39;&#39; = 0 \\] Resulting boundary condition is: \\[ \\color{purple} \\begin{aligned} f&#39; = 0\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta=0 \\quad\\mathrm{(no~slip)}\\\\ f = 0\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta=0 \\quad\\mathrm{(impenetrability)} \\\\ f&#39; = 1\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta\\rightarrow\\infty \\quad(u = U\\mathrm{~free stream}) \\\\ f&#39;&#39; = 0\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta\\rightarrow\\infty \\quad(\\partial_yu=0,\\mathrm{unnecessary}) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 5.5.3 Solving the similarity solution Split the 3-order ODE into a set of 3 first order ODEs: \\[ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} f_p = f&#39; \\\\ f_{pp} = f_p&#39; \\\\ 2f&#39;_{pp} +ff_{pp} = 0 \\end{array}\\right. \\] with boundary conditions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} f_p = 0\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta=0 \\\\ f = 0\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta=0 \\\\ f_p = 1\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta\\rightarrow\\infty \\\\ f_{pp} = 0\\quad &amp;at\\quad \\eta\\rightarrow\\infty,\\mathrm{unnecessary} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The third boundary condition has no closed form solution, so we need to solve it numerically. One method of doing it is guessing another initial condition \\(f_{pp} = ?\\) at \\(\\eta=0\\), integrating the equation from \\(\\eta=0\\) with Runge-Kutta method to meet the 3rd boundary condition i.e. transfer the boundary condition to the initial condition. Runge–Kutta method is an effective and widely used numerical method for solving the initial-value problems of differential equations. It integrated the function discretely from zero in small steps (\\(h\\)) in an order of 4 (more on LearnChemE's Youtube). \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y_{n+1}=y_{n}+\\frac{1}{6}\\left(K_{1}+2 K_{2}+2 K_{3}+K_{4}\\right) \\\\K_{1}=h f\\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\\right) \\\\K_{2}=h f\\left(x_{n}+\\frac{1}{2} h, y_{n}+\\frac{1}{2} K_{1}\\right) \\\\K_{3}=h f\\left(x_{n}+\\frac{1}{2} h, y_{n}+\\frac{1}{2} K_{2}\\right) \\\\K_{4}=h f\\left(x_{n}+h, y_{n}+K_{3}\\right)\\end{array}\\right.\\] It turns out it meets the 3rd boundary condition when: \\[ f_{pp} = 0.332~at~ \\eta=0 \\] And the function looks like below: From the solution, we can see the stream function \\(f\\) first increases with a decreasing slop then approaches to a linear increase line. While the velocity profile \\(f&#39;\\) and shear stress \\(f&#39;&#39;\\) approach the 1 and 0 at the free stream respectively, Another method is solve \\(f_{pp}~at~ \\eta=0\\) directly numerically. And the solution is: \\[ f_{pp} = 0.332096~at~ \\eta=0 \\] More on MECH 346 – Heat Transfer's Youtube channel and MIT's note. 5.5.4 Blasius results As a consequence, similar to what we do based on the Von Kármán results result, recall the definition of the boundary layer: \\[ f_p = \\frac{u|_\\delta}{U} = 0.99 \\] It is easy to get the boundary layer thickness: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\eta_1&amp;=\\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}}\\delta\\approx5.0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\delta &amp;\\approx 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\delta}{x} &amp;\\approx 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{Ux}} \\\\ \\color{purple}{\\frac{\\delta}{x} }&amp;\\color{purple}{\\approx 5 Re_x^{-1/2}}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] with \\(\\color{purple}Re_x= Ux/\\nu\\) as the streamwise Reynolds number. the thickness displacement: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\delta^* &amp;= \\int_0^\\delta\\left(1-\\frac{u}{U}\\right)dy \\\\ &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}}\\int_0^{\\eta_1\\approx5.0 }\\left(1-f&#39;\\right)d\\eta \\\\ &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}}\\left[\\eta_1 - f_1\\right]\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] with \\(f_1 \\approx 3.283\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\color{purple}\\frac{\\delta^*}{x}\\approx 1.721 Re_x^{-1/2} \\end{aligned} \\] the momentum displacement and the factor of friction: \\[ \\tau_w = \\rho\\nu\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}|_{y=0} = \\rho\\nu U\\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}}f&#39;&#39;(0) \\] with \\(f&#39;&#39;(0) \\approx 0.332\\): \\[ C_f = \\frac{\\tau_w}{1/2\\rho U^2} \\approx 0.664Re_x^{-1/2} \\] \\[ \\color{purple} \\frac{\\theta}{x} \\approx 0.664Re_x^{-1/2} \\] the shape factor: \\[ \\color{purple} H = \\frac{\\delta^*}{\\theta} \\approx 2.59 \\] 5.6 Validity of the laminar results The above results are based on the hypothesis that the boundary layer is thin enough so that the coupling with the outer flow is negligible. This theory breaks down as soon as \\(\\frac{\\delta}{x}=\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) i.e. \\(\\frac{\\delta}{x}&lt;0.1\\). As a result, based on the Blasius result, the upper limit of the streamwise Reynolds number depends on transition to turbulence writes \\[ 5Re_x^{-1/2}&lt;0.1\\\\ \\Rightarrow Re_{x,min} &gt; 2500 \\] For smaller \\(Re_x\\), the interaction with the outer flow is important and leads to departures from these results. Besides, at a threshold Reynolds number, the boundary layer becomes turbulent and the results above do not hold. This critical value of the Reynolds number is \\(Re_c\\approx 3 × 10^6\\). Usually, the surfaces are not smooth and transition occurs earlier, sometimes at Reynolds numbers as low as \\(10^5\\). 5.7 Comparison of the results Similar to what we do based on the Von Kármán results result, based on the Prandtl one-seventh power law, the turbulence results can be derived easily, here is the table of all results: Results \\(\\delta/x\\) \\(\\delta^*/x\\) \\(H\\) \\(c_f\\) Blasius laminar \\(5.0Re_x^{-1/2}\\) \\(1.72Re_x^{-1/2}\\) \\(2.59\\) \\(0.664Re_x^{-1/2}\\) Integral laminar \\(5.5Re_x^{-1/2}\\) \\(1.83Re_x^{-1/2}\\) \\(2.5\\) \\(0.73Re_x^{-1/2}\\) Error \\(10\\%\\) \\(6\\%\\) \\(3\\%\\) \\(10\\%\\) Integral turbulent \\(0.16Re_x^{-1/7}\\) \\(0.02Re_x^{-1/7}\\) \\(1.3\\) \\(0.027Re_x^{-1/7}\\) Several points: There is an error of less than 10% between integral and Blasius results. The boundary layer thickness \\(\\delta\\) grows like \\(x^{6/7}\\) for turbulent flows, which represents a faster growth than the \\(x^{1/2}\\) law for the laminar boundary layer. The viscous displacement thickness \\(\\delta^*\\) and the shape factor \\(H=\\delta^*/\\theta\\) for turbulent boundary layers is very small. The skin friction coefficient \\(c_f\\) is greater for turbulent boundary layers than for the laminar ones. Appendix A.1 Governing equation of boundary layers A.1.1 Scalings Started by scaling the spatial derivatives: \\[ \\partial_x \\sim \\frac{1}{L} \\qquad \\partial_y \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\] By the thin-layer condition: \\(L\\gg\\delta\\), we can introduce a small parameter \\(\\epsilon \\ll 1\\) as: \\[ \\frac{\\delta}{L} = \\epsilon \\] As a result, introduce the stream function \\(\\psi\\) under the conditions of 2D and incompressibility. The proportion of the streamwise and normal streamwise velocities \\(u, v\\) can be expressed as: \\[ \\frac{u}{v} = \\frac{\\partial_y\\psi}{-\\partial_x\\psi}\\sim\\frac{L}{\\delta} \\] which gives: \\[ \\Rightarrow \\quad v\\sim\\epsilon u \\] implying that the \\(v\\) is much smaller than \\(u\\). Then rescale the wall normal quantities according to the streamwise quantities: \\[ \\begin{aligned} x^* &amp;= \\frac{x}{L} \\\\ y^* &amp;= \\frac{y}{\\delta} = \\frac{y}{\\epsilon L}\\\\ u^* &amp;= \\frac{u}{U} \\\\ v^* &amp;= \\frac{v}{\\epsilon U} \\\\ p^* &amp;= \\frac{p}{\\rho U^2} \\end{aligned} \\] In this case, \\(p^*\\) can be thought of as a mathematical function to ensure incompressibility of the scaled function. A.1.2 Asymptotic derivation Substitute the scaled variables into the governing equations: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{U}{L} \\partial_{x^{*}} u^{*}+\\frac{\\epsilon U}{\\epsilon L} \\partial_{y^{*}} v^{*} &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{U^{2}}{L} u^{*} \\partial_{x^{*}} u^{*}+\\frac{U^{2}}{L} v^{*} \\partial_{y^{*}} u^{*}&amp;=-\\frac{ U^{2}}{L} \\partial_{x^{*}} p^{*}+\\nu\\left(\\frac{U}{L^{2}} \\partial_{x^{*}}^{2} u^{*}+\\frac{U}{\\epsilon^{2} L^{2}} \\partial_{y^{*}}^{2} u^{*}\\right) \\\\ \\frac{\\epsilon U^{2}}{L} u^{*} \\partial_{x^{*}} v^{*}+\\frac{\\epsilon U^{2}}{L} v^{*} \\partial_{y^{*}} v^{*} &amp;=-\\frac{ U^{2}}{\\epsilon L} \\partial_{y^{*}} p^{*}+\\nu\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon U}{L^{2}} \\partial_{x^{*}}^{2} v^{*}+\\frac{U}{\\epsilon L^{2}} \\partial_{y^{*}}^{2} v^{*}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Can be simplified into: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\partial_{x^{*}} u^{*}+\\partial_{y^{*}} v^{*} &amp;= 0 \\\\ u^{*} \\partial_{x^{*}} u^{*}+v^{*} \\partial_{y^{*}} u^{*} &amp;=-\\partial_{x^{*}} p^{*}+\\frac{1}{Re_{L}} \\partial_{x^{*}}^{2} u^{*}+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2} Re_{L}} \\partial_{y^{*}}^{2} u^{*} \\\\ u^{*} \\partial_{x^{*}} v^{*}+v^{*} \\partial_{y^{*}} v^{*} &amp;=-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2}} \\partial_{y^{*}} p^{*}+\\frac{1}{Re_{L}} \\partial_{x^{*}}^{2} v^{*}+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2} Re_{L}} \\partial_{y^{*}}^{2} v^{*} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(Re_L = UL/\\nu\\) To keep a balance between the advection(LHS) and diffusion (RHS), impose: \\[ \\epsilon^2Re_L=1 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta}{L}=Re_L^{-1/2} \\] As a result, the leading order of the system is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\partial_{x^{*}} u^{*}+\\partial_{y^{*}} v^{*} &amp;= 0 \\\\ u^{*} \\partial_{x^{*}} u^{*}+v^{*} \\partial_{y^{*}} u^{*} &amp;=-\\partial_{x^{*}} p^{*}+\\partial_{y^{*}}^{2} u^{*} \\\\ 0&amp;=\\partial_{y^{*}} p^{*} \\end{aligned} \\] A.2 Solving the heat equation using similarity solution References：Dr Chris Tisdell's Youtube, UCL's class note.

Drilling a long hole into the Earth and placing a duct in, the oil reservoir possesses a higher pressure then the atmosphere thus the oil is pushed upwards along the duct. Steam injection, drilling a second hole to inject steam, the addition of steam increase the pressure and push the oil further upwards. The increase in temperature reduces the viscosity. 1.1.2 Pipeline transport Transport systems designed to bring the oil to storage or treatment sites face many challenges. Take Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) as an example, oil extracted is substantially warmer than anything at the surface, the permafrost (frozen ground) may warm up and become unstable. To avoid this , radiators have beed placed next to the pipeline. Besides, drag-reducing agents DRA are mixed with the oil to reduce the viscous drag produced by the massive turbulent flow inside. 1.1.3 Biological flow The cerebral blood flow in the cortex can be modelled through a complex assembly of ducts, mimicking the vessel network present in the brain. Experimental data coupled with numerical simulations can then provide prediction of the pressure map in the brain.Access to these results can then be used to predict the risks of blockage or damage of the vessels and thus of brain stroke. 1.2 Reynolds number In 1883, Osbourne Reynolds published his famous pipe flow experiment. He placed a pipe within a tank full of water. The water entered in the pipe through a converging cone to decrease the impact of entrance effects and the flow rate is controled by a valve. Aligned with the entrance of the pipe is a needle connected to a dye container. As the desired flow rate is reached, dye is injected within the pipe to trace out the fluid’s trajectory. In addition to making these observations, it is possible to characterise these different regimes in a simple manner, the quantities that influence the flow are: pipe diameter \\(l\\): \\([l]=L\\) fluid's velocity \\(u\\): \\([u]=LT^{-1}\\) fluid's density \\(\\rho\\): \\([\\rho] = mL^{-3}\\) fluid's dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\): \\([\\mu]=mL^{-1}T^{-1}\\) Combine these quantities to obtain a dimensionless number called Reynolds number, \\[ \\color{purple} Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu} \\] With Reynolds number, 3 regimes of flow can be defined: Laminar flows: \\(0&lt;Re&lt;1000\\) Transitional flows: \\(1000&lt;Re&lt;4000\\) Turbulent flows: \\(4000&lt;Re\\) The intermittent bursts of turbulence displayed in the transitional regime are the signature of the passage of turbulent puffs. They can be observed by direct numerical simulation, like the figure above for Re = 2300. The upstream edge of the puff is well-defined, while the downstream edge is elongated and fuzzy. Puffs typically evolve in two different ways: Vanishing and decaying down to the laminar state or splitting, leading to an increasingly large turbulent fraction in the flow. Puffs decay rapidly in the laminar regime and split frequently in the turbulent regime, but they remain long-lived in the transitional one. The lifetime of a puff before decaying and splitting in pipe flow is studied as a function of Reynolds number, and the results are shown below. It is confirmed that the puffs are long-lived over a wide range of \\(Re\\)s. Importantly, there is an intersection between the decay and the splitting lifetime curves. This intersection provides a well-defined legitimate threshold between laminar and turbulent flows: \\(Re_c≈ 2040\\). 1.3 Other considerations 1.3.1 Newtonian/non-Newtonian fluids Water and air all follow the rule of constant viscosity, that is, the wall shear stress is \\(\\mu\\) proportional to the normal velocity gradient (shear, strain rate): \\[ \\tau = \\mu\\partial_nu \\] But not all types of fluids follow this law, as seen below. Shear thinning: ketchup, becoming less and less viscous as they are stirred. Shear thickening: corn starch, getting much harder to strain as they receive more stress. Mayonnaise: tooth paste, possessing a threshold stress below which they behave like solids and above which their rheological law is linear. If you hang the open container upside down, it will not flow. An additional force is needed on the container to create a flow. More complicated, Herschel–Bulkley fluids (e.g. paint) or even time-dependent visco-elastic fluids (e.g. polymers). 1.3.2 Compressibility When the flow speed reach the speed of sound, the fluid becomes compressible, meaning the density becomes variant in time and space. The best unidimensional quantity to describe this threshold is called Mach number: \\[ Ma = \\frac{u}{c} \\] where the \\(c\\) is the speed of sound, and the flowing regimes are observed defined by \\(Ma\\). \\(0&lt;Ma&lt;0.3\\): incompressible flows. \\(0.3&lt;Ma&lt;1\\): compressible subsonic flows. \\(1&lt;Ma\\): compressible supersonic flows. 2 Laminar flow cases 2.1 Incompressible framework 2.1.1 The Navier-Stokes equation The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation describes the motion of fluids under external forces. It writes: \\[ \\color{purple} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{V}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{f} -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} p + \\nu\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}^2\\mathbf{V} \\] The left-hand-side of the Navier–Stokes equation represents inertia. It involves the rate of change of the velocity with time ∂tu as well as advection (u · ∇) u. The latter term quantifies how the fluid is transported by the flow velocity. In an equation such as the heat equation, this term applies to the temperature T, reads (u · ∇) T and quantifies how temperature is transported by the flow velocity. The right-hand-side represents all the forces acting on the fluid. In addition to the external forces f that we will not take into account in this Chapter, the other terms come from the divergence of the stress tensor. They include the pressure gradient −∇p that translates the fact that the fluid is attracted to low pressure regions and the viscous force μ∇2u quantifying the internal friction between in the fluid. 2.1.2 Continuity equation Recall the mass conservation equation in the Eulerian frame of reference, \\[ \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{V})=0 \\] And with the incompressibility consumption, \\[ \\color{purple} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{V} = 0 \\] 2.1.2 Additional hypotheses In the laminar flow regime, it is common to assume the flow as: steady: \\(\\partial_t=0\\) unidirectional: the flow is parallel the to walls symmetry: the flow is further simplified using the symmetries of the geometry 2.2 Pipe flow 2.2.1 Cylindrical coordinate In cylindrical coordinate, the velocity: \\[ \\mathbf{V} = u_r\\mathbf{\\hat {r}}+u_\\theta\\boldsymbol{\\hat {\\theta}}+u_z\\mathbf{\\hat {z}} \\] The line element writes: \\[ ds = dr\\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + rd\\theta\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}+dz\\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\] The gradient operator： \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} = \\partial_r\\mathbf{\\hat {r}}+\\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta\\boldsymbol{\\hat {\\theta}}+\\partial_z\\mathbf{\\hat {z}} \\] And the directions change with \\(\\theta\\), as a consequence: \\[ \\partial_\\theta\\mathbf{\\hat{r}} = \\boldsymbol{\\hat {\\theta}}, \\qquad \\partial_\\theta\\boldsymbol{\\hat {\\theta}} = -\\mathbf{\\hat{r}} \\] Some useful equations: $$ \\[\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{V} =&amp;

The average velocity can be calculated as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} u_z|_{avg} &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2}\\int_0^R\\left[\\frac{R^2\\partial_z p}{4\\mu}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{R^2}-1\\right)\\right]2\\pi rdr \\\\ &amp;= -\\frac{R^2\\partial_z p}{8\\mu} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac12u_z|_{max} \\end{aligned} \\] The flow rate: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Q &amp;= A u_z|_{avg} \\\\ &amp;=-\\frac{\\pi R^4\\partial_z p}{8\\mu} \\end{aligned} \\] If the total pressure drop in the pipe with a length of \\(L\\) has a value: \\[ \\Delta p = \\partial_zpL \\] The flow rate is therefore: \\[ Q = -\\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta p}{8\\mu L} \\] And the wall shear stress is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\tau_{w} &amp;= \\mu \\partial_r u_z|_{r = R} \\\\ &amp;= -\\frac{R\\Delta p}{2L} \\end{aligned} \\] Note that \\(\\tau_w\\) can be related with the average velocity, and therefore the flow rate: \\[ \\tau_w =\\frac{4\\mu u_z|_{avg}}{R} \\] 2.3 Other cases 2.3.1 Non-viscous pipe flow Inviscid flows are yielded by the Euler function (ignore the body force): \\[ \\partial_t\\mathbf{V}+\\mathbf{V}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\mathbf{V} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} p \\] and the continuity function: \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{V} = 0 \\] And because of the inviscid condition, the boundary equation at the wall is stated as \"free-slip\", instead of the \"no-slip\" condition: \\[ u_r|_{r=R}=0\\qquad\\partial_ru_\\theta|_{r=R} = 0\\qquad \\partial_ru_z|_{r=R}=0 \\] The incompressibility constraint simplifies into: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\partial_zu_z=0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad&amp;\\partial_z=Const. \\end{aligned} \\] Assumptions:Laminar flowIncompressibleSteadyHomogeneous in \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) directionsinviscid The maximum and average values are equal: \\[ u_z|_{max} = u_z|_{avg} = u_z \\] and the flow rate is: \\[ Q = Au_z = \\pi R^2u_z \\] And there is no friction shear stress at walls. 2.3.2 Channel flow Channel flow describes a three-dimensional flow confined between two parallel plates and driven similarly to pipe flow by a pressure gradient. Assumptions:Laminar flowIncompressibleSteadyHomogeneous in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) directionsviscous Similar to the Poiseuille flow, yet in the cartesian coordinate, the velocity is defined as: \\[ \\mathbf{V} = u_x(y)\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} \\] And the N-S equation is reduced to: \\[ 0 = -\\partial_xp+\\mu\\partial_y^2u_x \\] with the boundary conditions: \\[ \\mathbf{V}|_{y=\\pm h} = \\mathbf{0} \\] The velocity is therefore: \\[ \\color{purple} u_x = \\frac{\\partial_xph^2}{2\\mu}\\left(\\frac{y^2}{h^2}-1\\right) \\] This is also called plane Poiseuille flow. 2.3.3 Plane Couette flow Plane Couette flow describes a three-dimensional flow confined between two parallel plates yet driven by sliding walls. Same assumptions are adopted as the channel flow. Similar to the channel flow, the velocity governing equation is: \\[ 0 = \\mu\\partial_y^2u_x \\] Yet the boundary conditions are changed to be: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;u_x|_{y=h} = U \\\\ &amp;u_x|_{y=-h} = -U \\end{aligned} \\] As the velocity function become: \\[ \\color{purple} u_x =- \\frac{ U}{h}y \\] 3 Viscous losses 3.1 Pressure drop 3.1.1 Experimental evidence In 1839, Hagen studied water flows in long brass pipes and hinted at the possible existence of two different regimes of viscous flows: laminar and turbulent. He characterised, in particular, laminar flows through the following law: \\[ \\Delta p = k\\frac{LQ}{R^4}+\\mathrm{entrance~effects} \\] where \\(k = Const.\\), \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe, \\(Q\\) the flow rate and \\(R\\) the radius of the pipe. As he increased Q beyond a certain threshold, Hagen observed that this law broke down, and deduced the existence of a second regime. This experimental observations are easily reproduced and the results sketched in figure below. 3.1.2 Dimensional analysis We consider a laminar flow in a horizontal pipe for which density and gravity effects are negligible. The dimensions of related quantities are: pressure drop \\(\\Delta p\\): \\([\\Delta p] = [ML^{-1}T^{-2}]\\) flow rate \\(Q\\): \\([Q]=[L^3T^-1]\\) pipe length \\(L\\): \\([L]=[L]\\) pipe radius \\(R\\):\\([R]=[L]\\) fluid's dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\): \\([\\mu]=[ML^-1T^-1]\\) As the pressure gradient is constant along the pipe and the flow fully characterised by the radial direction only, we can write \\[ \\frac{\\Delta p}{L}=\\mathcal{F}(Q, R, \\mu) \\] We note that the left-hand-side has dimension proportional to a mass M and that only the dynamic viscosity has dimension proportional to a mass. We can then divide by the dynamic viscosity to get rid of this dimension. \\[ \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\mu L}=\\mathcal{F}(Q, R) \\] Similarly, to get rid of the length dimension, multiply by \\(R\\). Then divide by \\(R^3\\). \\[ \\frac{\\Delta p R}{\\mu L}=\\mathcal{F}(\\frac{Q}{R^3}) \\] At this stage, both the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side terms are both homogeneous to the inverse of a time. Upon dividing the one by the other, we obtain the following relationship: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta p R^4}{\\mu LQ}=Const. \\] which provide the following pressure loss drop law: \\[ \\Delta p = C_{onst.} \\mu\\frac{ LQ}{ R^4} \\] This law is very similar to that obtained experimentally by Hagen. In particular, it shows that Hagen’s constant \\(k\\) is homogeneous to a dynamic viscosity. 3.1.3 Theoretical answer Recall the streamwise velocity reads: \\[ u_z=\\frac{R^2\\partial_z p}{4\\mu}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{R^2}-1\\right) \\] giving the following flow rate: \\[ Q = -\\frac{\\pi R^4\\Delta p}{8\\mu L} \\] And the $p $ as a function of \\(Q,R,\\mu,L\\) reads: \\[ \\color{purple} \\Delta p = \\frac{8}{\\pi}\\mu\\frac{LQ}{R^4} \\] 3.2 Head loss 3.2.1 The Bernoulli equation As a result of the friction between the fluid and the wall, the energy and head decrease between these two sections. We take this into account by adding a term to the Bernoulli equation as: \\[ \\frac{p_1}{\\rho g}+\\frac{u_1^2}{2g}+z_1 = \\frac{p_2}{\\rho g}+\\frac{u_2^2}{2g}+z_2+h_f \\] where \\(h_f\\) is called head loss and accounts for the viscous dissipation. The equivalent loss of energy per unit volume is \\(\\rho ghf\\). Relevantly, \\(\\frac{p}{\\rho g}\\) is called pressure head and \\(\\frac{u^2}{2g}\\) is called kinetic head. Conditions:SteadyIncompressibleStreamwiseViscous. 3.2.2 Application to pipe flow Given a inclined laminar pipe. The velocity of the fluid is invariant with the streamwise direction \\(x\\), so \\(u_1= u_2\\). We can then express the head loss: \\[ h_f = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\rho g}+\\Delta z \\] Apply the momentum equation for the control volume shown above: \\[ \\Sigma F_x = \\rho\\pi R^2\\left(u_{2avg}^2-u_{1avg}^2\\right) \\] There are three forces acting on the fluid in the x direction： pressure: \\(\\Delta p\\pi R^2\\) weight: \\(\\rho L \\pi R^2 \\sin(\\phi)g\\) shear: \\(-\\tau_w2\\pi RL\\) Additionally, with constant fluid velocity i.e. \\(u_{1avg} = u_{2avg}\\), the momentum equation can be simplified as: \\[ \\Delta p\\pi R^2+\\rho L \\pi R^2 \\sin(\\phi)g-\\tau_w2\\pi RL=0 \\] as a result: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\rho g}+\\Delta z = \\frac{2\\tau_wL}{\\rho gR} \\] and the head loss therefore writes: \\[ \\color{purple} h_f = \\frac{2\\tau_wL}{\\rho gR} = \\frac{4\\tau_wL}{\\rho gd} \\] Recall the wall shear for the Poiseuille flow, \\(\\tau_w =\\frac{4\\mu u_{avg}}{R}\\) \\[ \\color{purple} h_f = \\frac{8\\mu u_{avg} L}{\\rho gR^2} = \\frac{32\\mu u_{avg} L}{\\rho gd^2} \\] 3.2.3 Physical interpretation We can experimentally observe quantities related to the Bernoulli equation. Static pressure tubes directly connected to the side of the pipe directly observe the pressure head \\(p/ρg\\). When this quantity is summed with the altitude \\(z\\) and tracked along the pipe, we obtain the hydraulic grade line. The use of Pitot tubes provides additional information: as they are oriented in the direction of the flow, they are sensitive to the fluid’s velocity and include the kinetic head \\(u^2/2g\\). The line obtained by summing the kinetic head together with the pressure head and the altitude is called energy grade line. When viscous effects are non-negligible, the head loss can be observed as loss of pressure and therefore as a drop for both lines. This situation is depicted below: 3.2.4 General formulae (Turbulent flow) The theory above only describes the steady laminar flow, but flows are often turbelent in applications. A need for general expression of head loss arose. In 1850, Weisbach used physical intuition to lead the way to a unifying theory. He realised that the head loss was proportional to \\(L/d\\) and also approximately proportional to \\(u_{avg}^2\\) experimentally for turbulent flows. He then suggested the following relationship: \\[ \\color{purple} h_f = f\\frac{L}{d}\\frac{u_{avg}^2}{2g} \\] where f is a non-dimensional parameter called Darcy friction factor. Still out of physical intuition, he precised that the friction factor depend on the Reynolds number, the duct shape and the roughness of the wall for turbulent flows. For laminar flow in a pipe: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{32 \\mu u_{a v g} L}{\\rho g d^{2}} &amp;=f_{l a m} \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{u_{a v g}^{2}}{2 g} \\\\ \\Rightarrow f_{l a m} &amp;=\\frac{64 \\mu u_{a v g} L d g}{\\rho g d^{2} L u_{a v g}^{2}}, \\\\ \\Rightarrow f_{\\text {lam }} &amp;=\\frac{64 \\mu}{\\rho d u_{a v g}} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\color{purple}{f_{l a m} }&amp; \\color{purple}{=\\frac{64}{R e_{d}}} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(Re_d\\) denotes the Reynolds number based on the diameter of the pipe For turbulent flow: No theoretical or experimental laws, in 1939, Colebrook provided an interpolation formula of empirical data: \\[ \\frac{1}{f^{1 / 2}}=-2 \\log \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon / d}{3.7}+\\frac{2.51}{R e_{d} f^{1 / 2}}\\right) \\] where \\(\\epsilon/d\\) (roughness height) quantifies the relative roughness of the walls, with \\(\\epsilon\\) being related to the size of the disturbance from a smooth wall. For a perfectly smooth pipe, \\(\\epsilon/d = 0\\). And this value increase with the roughness of the wall. Colebrook’s formula is transcendental and cannot be solved by hand. Hence, in 1944, Moody plotted what is now known as the Moody chart (below) to provide directly readable data. This chart is nowadays a standard in the engineering world. 3.3 Entrance effects 3.3.1 Definition Away from the pipe, the external flow is homogeneous (therefore, not dissipative, or conservative); the flow within the pipe displays vanishing velocity at the wall due to viscosity. It is dissipative. Thus, there is a region (time if you follow the fluid) where the flow progressively accommodates to the presence of walls. This region is called entrance region and this progress is called the entrance effects, firstly observed by Hagen. 3.3.2 Entrance length Use dimensional analysis: The entrance length \\(L_e=[L]\\) is related to: pipe diameter \\(d\\): \\([d]=[L]\\) average fluid velocity \\(u_{avg}\\): \\(u_{avg}=[LT^{-1}]\\) fluid's density \\(\\rho\\): \\(\\rho = [ML^{-3}]\\) fluid's dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\): \\(\\mu = [ML^{-1}T^{-1}]\\) As \\([L_e/d]=[1]\\), combine other quantities to get a dimensionless product: \\[ \\begin{aligned} u_{avg}^a \\rho^b \\mu^c d^d &amp;= L^{a}T^{-a}M^{b}L^{-3b}M^{c}L^{-c}T^{-c}L^d \\\\ &amp;= L^{a-3b-c+d}T^{-a-c}M^{b+c} = L^0T^0M^0\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp;\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} a-3b-c+d=0 \\\\ -a-c=0 \\\\ b+c=0 \\end{array}\\right.\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad &amp;a=b=d=-c \\end{aligned} \\] As a result, let \\(c=\\gamma\\): \\[ \\left[\\frac{L_{e}}{d}\\right]=\\left[\\frac{\\rho u_{a v g} d}{\\mu}\\right]^{\\gamma} \\] The RHS is Reynolds number based on the diameter of the pipe, \\(Re_d\\), finally: \\[ \\color{purple} \\frac{L_e}{d}= \\mathcal{F}(Re_d^\\gamma) \\] the following empirical laws shows that: laminar flows: \\(\\frac{L_e}{d}\\approx0.06Re_d\\) turbulent flows: \\(\\frac{L_e}{d}\\approx1.6Re_d\\) Note that these laws provide some interesting differences between laminar and turbulent flows: at \\(Re_d= 2000\\), the entrance length of a laminar flow is \\(L_e= 120d\\) while a turbulent flow at \\(Re_d= 10000\\) will yield an entrance length of only \\(L_e= 16d\\).","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fluid dynamics","slug":"fluid-dynamics","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/fluid-dynamics/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Derivation of Non-dimensional NS Equations","slug":"Derivation-of-Non-dimensional-NS-Equations","date":"2022-05-20T02:13:03.000Z","updated":"2022-05-20T16:26:44.229Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/20/Derivation-of-Non-dimensional-NS-Equations/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/05/20/Derivation-of-Non-dimensional-NS-Equations/","excerpt":"Feeling unsafe when deploying CFD algorithms, the best way to alleviate the anxiety is to derive the fundamentals again.","text":"Feeling unsafe when deploying CFD algorithms, the best way to alleviate the anxiety is to derive the fundamentals again.

Identify the number of fundamental dimensions, \\(N\\), involved. Select \\(N\\) parameters to be scaling parameters with which to define dimensionless variables. Note: There are often multiple choices here and the choice will depend on exactly what we are aiming to show with our data.

Substitute into the equation and simplify to arrive at its non-dimensional form. Some rules for selecting scaling parameters: They must not form a dimensionless group amongst themselves. For example: \\[ S_{0}^{a} V_{0}^{b}=[L]^{a}\\left[L T^{-1}\\right]^{b}=L^{0} T^{0} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad a=b=0 \\] Do not include the output variables you wish to analyse/plot. Example Give the falling-body equation, and follow the process \\[ S = S_0+V_0t+\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\] Divide the variables and parameters: \\[ \\mathrm{Variables:~}S,t,\\qquad\\mathrm{Parameters:~}S_0,V_0,g \\] Identify the dimensions: \\[ S = [L], \\quad t=[T],\\quad S_0=[L],\\quad V_0=[L/t],\\quad g=[L/t^2] \\] And 2 dimensions exist: \\([L]\\) and \\([T]\\) There are 3 options of parameters choosing, choose \\((S_0,V_0)\\) for instance, Non-dimensional variables can be described as: \\[ S^* = \\frac{1}{S_0}S \\qquad t^* = \\frac{V_0}{S_0}t \\] Subscribe into the function to get a non-dimensional form of it: \\[ S^* = 1+t^*+\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^{*2}, \\quad \\mathrm{with} \\quad \\alpha = \\frac{gS_0}{V_0^2} \\] It is a function of a single dimensionless parameter \\(\\alpha\\) identifying the effect of gravity. Similarly, choose \\((S_0,g)\\), we have \\[ S^{**} = \\frac{g}{V_0^2}S \\qquad t^{**} = \\frac{g}{V_0}t \\] The non-dimensional form body-drop function is therefore: \\[ S^* = \\alpha+ t^{**}+ \\frac{1}{2}gt^{**},\\quad \\mathrm{with} \\quad \\alpha=\\frac{gS_0}{V_0^2} \\] Here, \\(\\alpha\\) identifies the effect of \\(V_0\\). The reduction in the number of variables/parameters (2 in this case, from 5 down to 3) equals the number of fundamental dimensions of the problem. This observation was formalised by Buckingham. 4 Buckingham’s Pi theorem Proposed by Buckingham in 1914, it is a means of finding dimensionless groups, or \\(\\Pi\\)s If a physical process satisfies the PDH(Principle of Dimensional Homogeneity) and involves \\(n\\) dimensional variables, it can be reduced to a relation between only \\(k\\) dimensionless variables or \\(\\Pi\\)s. The reduction \\(j = n - k\\) equals the maximum number of variables that do not form a \\(\\Pi\\) among themselves and is always less than or equal to the number of dimensions describing the variables. Find the reduction \\(j\\), then select \\(j\\) scaling variables that do not form a \\(\\Pi\\) among themselves. Each desired \\(\\Pi\\) group will be a power product of these \\(j\\) variables plus one additional variable, which is assigned any convenient nonzero exponent. Each \\(\\Pi\\) group thus found is independent. The first part of this theorem describes what sort of a reduction we can achieve for a given equation. The second part describes a methodology for systematically identifying \\(\\Pi\\)’s Example 1 Suppose we have that the drag force on a body depends on length of the body, velocity of the flow, density and viscosity of the fluid: \\[ F = f(L,V,\\rho,\\mu) \\] Dimensions of each variables are: \\[ F=\\left[M L T^{-2}\\right], \\quad L=[L], \\quad V=\\left[L T^{-1}\\right], \\quad \\rho=\\left[M L^{-3}\\right], \\quad \\mu=\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right] \\] 3 dimensions exist, \\(j=3\\) And we expect to find \\(k = 5-3 = 2 ~\\Pi\\) groups. We are intersted in how the drag force relates to the velocity, so we choose \\((L,\\rho,\\mu)\\), The two \\(\\Pi\\)s are: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\Pi_{1}=L^{a} \\rho^{b} \\mu^{c} F=L^{0} \\rho^{1} \\mu^{-2} F &amp; {[1]\\left[M L^{-3}\\right]\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right]^{-2}\\left[M L T^{-2}\\right]=\\left[M^{0} L^{0} T^{0}\\right]} \\\\ \\Pi_{2}=L^{a} \\rho^{b} \\mu^{c} V=L^{1} \\rho^{1} \\mu^{-1} V &amp; {[L]\\left[M L^{-3}\\right]\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right]^{-1}\\left[L T^{-1}\\right]=\\left[M^{0} L^{0} T^{0}\\right]} \\end{array} \\] As a result we have the dimensionless coefficients: \\[ C_{f}=\\frac{\\rho F}{\\mu^{2}}=f(\\mathrm{Re}) \\quad \\text { with } R e=\\frac{\\rho L V}{\\mu} \\] \\(C_f\\) is the force coefficients and \\(Re\\) is the famous Reynolds number. Example 2 At low velocities (laminar flow), the volume flow \\(Q\\) through a small-bore tube is a function only of the tube radius \\(R\\), the fluid viscosity \\(\\mu\\) and the pressure drop per unit tube length \\(dp/dx\\). Using the Pi theorem, find an appropriate dimensionless relationship. We have: \\[ Q = f(R,\\mu,dp/dx) \\] with dimensions: \\[ Q=\\left[L^{3} T^{-1}\\right], \\quad R=[L], \\quad \\mu=\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right], \\quad d p / d x=\\left[M L^{-2} T^{-2}\\right] \\] 3 dimensions \\(\\Rightarrow\\) 3 scaling variables &amp; 1 \\(\\Pi\\) group. Choose \\((R, \\mu, dp/dx)\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pi_{1} &amp;=R^{a} \\mu^{b}(d p / d x)^{c} Q \\\\ &amp;=[L]^{a}\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right]^{b}\\left[M L^{-2} T^{-2}\\right]^{c}\\left[L^{3} T^{-1}\\right] \\\\ &amp;=\\left[M^{0} L^{0} T^{0}\\right] \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad a=-4, b=1, c=-1 \\end{aligned} \\] Therefore we have: \\[ C = \\frac{Q\\mu}{R^4(dp/dx)} \\] 5 Non-dimensionalisation of the governing equations Give incompressible, no gravity governing equations. Take the case of open flow past an infinitely long circular cylinder. The continuity and momentum equations are given by: \\[ \\begin{aligned} 0 &amp;= \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{V} \\\\ \\rho\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{V}}{dt} &amp;= -\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}p + \\mu \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}^2\\mathbf{V} \\end{aligned} \\] Plus boundary conditions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Solid~surface:~}&amp;\\mathbf{V}=0 \\\\ \\mathrm{Inlet~or~outlet:~}&amp;\\mathrm{Known}~\\mathbf{V},p \\end{aligned} \\] Plus the cylinder has diameter \\(D\\) and the flow has free-stream velocity of \\(U_0\\). Recall that one might suppose that our velocity field is a function of the cylinder diameter, the free-stream velocity, as well as the fluid density and viscosity. We have that: \\[ \\mathbf{V} = f(\\mathbf{x},t,p,D,U_0,\\rho,\\mu) \\] with dimensions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pi_{1} &amp;=R^{a} \\mu^{b}(d p / d x)^{c} Q \\\\ &amp;=[L]^{a}\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right]^{b}\\left[M L^{-2} T^{-2}\\right]^{c}\\left[L^{3} T^{-1}\\right] \\\\ &amp;=\\left[M^{0} L^{0} T^{0}\\right] \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad a=-4, b=1, c=-1 \\end{aligned} \\] 3 dimensions and 8 variables \\(\\Rightarrow\\) 3 scaling variables &amp; 5 \\(\\Pi\\) group. Choose \\((D,U_0,\\rho)\\) since they cannot form a \\(\\Pi\\) group, we have: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\Pi_{1}=U_{0}^{a} D^{b} \\rho^{c} V=U_{0}^{-1} V \\\\ &amp;\\Pi_{2}=U_{0}^{a} D^{b} \\rho^{c} \\mathbf{x}=D^{-1} \\mathbf{x} \\\\ &amp;\\Pi_{3}=U_{0}^{a} D^{b} \\rho^{c} t=U_{0} D^{-1} t \\\\ &amp;\\Pi_{4}=U_{0}^{a} D^{b} \\rho^{c} p=\\left[L T^{-1}\\right]^{a}[L]^{b}\\left[M L^{-3}\\right]^{c}\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-2}\\right]=U_{0}^{-2} \\rho^{-1} p \\\\ &amp;\\Pi_{5}=U_{0}^{a} D^{b} \\rho^{c} \\mu=\\left[L T^{-1}\\right]^{a}[L]^{b}\\left[M L^{-3}\\right]^{c}\\left[M L^{-1} T^{-1}\\right]=U_{0}^{-1} D^{-1} \\rho^{-1} \\mu \\end{aligned} \\] Therefore: \\[ \\frac{V}{U_{0}}=f\\left(\\frac{x}{D}, \\frac{t U_{0}}{D}, \\frac{p}{U_{0}^{2} \\rho}, \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho U_{0} D}\\right) \\] Use above to write down the non-dimensional scaling of the parameters: \\[ V^{*}=\\frac{1}{U_{0}} V \\quad \\mathbf{x}^{*}=\\frac{1}{D} \\mathbf{x} \\quad t^{*}=\\frac{U_{0}}{D} t \\quad p^{*}=\\frac{1}{\\rho U_{0}^{2}} p \\quad \\nabla^{*}=D \\nabla \\quad \\mu^{*}=\\frac{1}{\\rho U_{0} D} \\mu \\] Therefore the non-dimensional form of N-S equations: \\[ \\begin{aligned} 0 &amp;= \\boldsymbol{\\nabla^*}\\cdot\\mathbf{V^*} \\\\ \\rho\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{V^*}}{dt^*} &amp;= -\\boldsymbol{\\nabla^*}p^* + \\frac{1}{Re} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla^{*2}}\\mathbf{V^*} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(Re = \\frac{\\rho U_0D}{\\mu}\\) and with boundary conditions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Solid~surface:~}&amp;\\mathbf{V^*}=0 \\\\ \\mathrm{Inlet~or~outlet:~}&amp;\\mathrm{Known}~\\mathbf{V^*},p^* \\end{aligned} \\] In this case, rather than analysing our flow problem with respect to the four parameters (cylinder radius, free-stream velocity, density and viscosity), we need only analyse it with respect to the single dimensionless Reynolds number. Besides, the above can be generalised by considering \\(U_0\\) and \\(D\\) to be any characteristic velocity- and length-scale of the specific problem being considered. 6 Dimensionless parameters To conclude we highlight a couple of the dimensionless parameters which can arise in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. There are no dimensionless parameters in the continuity equation. However, there is one in the momentum equation, the Reynolds number \\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho U_0D}{\\mu} \\] It can be considered as the ratio of inertial to viscous effects and is widely considered the most important parameter in fluid mechanics. If the free-stream velocity \\(U_0\\) were instead considered to be oscillating rather than constant, and of the form: \\[ U = U_0\\cos(\\omega t) \\] then the problem can be considered as: \\[ \\mathbf{V} = f(\\mathbf{x},t,p,D,U_0,\\rho,\\mu, \\omega) \\] And the non-dimensionalised \\(U(t)\\), we observe that: \\[ \\frac{U}{U_0}=U^*=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega D}{U_0}t^*\\right) \\] where \\(\\omega\\) is the frequency. We now have an additional dimensionless parameter called the Strouhal number: \\[ St = \\frac{\\omega D}{U_0} \\] There are many other dimensionless parameters which arise in specific types of flow problems.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fluid dynamics","slug":"fluid-dynamics","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/fluid-dynamics/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Derivation of Differential Fluid Equations","slug":"Derivation-of-Differential-Fluid-Equations","date":"2022-05-14T08:54:02.000Z","updated":"2022-05-29T07:55:39.096Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/14/Derivation-of-Differential-Fluid-Equations/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/05/14/Derivation-of-Differential-Fluid-Equations/","excerpt":"Feeling unsafe when deploying CFD algorithms, the best way to alleviate the anxiety is to derive the fundamentals again.","text":"Feeling unsafe when deploying CFD algorithms, the best way to alleviate the anxiety is to derive the fundamentals again. 1 Acceleration and Mass Conservation 1.1 Acceleration field of a fluid 1.1.1 Material / substantial / convective derivatives Given a spatial-temporal property \\(f(x,y,z,t)\\) of a fluid particle in the Eulerian coordinate.

Like the Reynolds Transport Theorem in the integral part, the material derivative connects the Lagrangian and Eulerian frame of references. 1.1.2 Material derivative of velocity Set \\(f\\) as \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) and the fluid acceleration as \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), substitute to the formula above: \\[ \\mathbf{a} = \\frac{D \\mathbf{V} }{D t}=\\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t}}_{\\text {local}} + \\underbrace{\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\mathbf{V}}_{\\text {convective}} \\] where \\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t}\\) is called local acceleration while \\((\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}) \\mathbf{V}\\) is the convective acceleration.

For Newtonian flow in a Cartesian coordinates: \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}=\\mu\\left[2\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right)^{2}+2\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right)^{2}+2\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\] Dissipated energy means during the flow, it is converted into the internal energy of the material. Note \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) is always positive, implying that viscous flow always loses energy. Expanding \\(e = \\hat{u}+\\frac{1}{2}V^{2}+gz\\), the general differential energy equation is : \\[ \\color{purple} \\rho \\frac{D \\hat{u}}{D t}+p(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{V})=\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot(k \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} T)+\\mathbf{\\Phi} \\] with further assumptions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} d \\hat{u} &amp; \\approx c_{v} d T \\\\ c_{v}, \\mu, k, \\rho &amp; \\approx \\mathrm{const} \\end{aligned} \\] for incompressible flow, we have: \\[ \\color{purple}{\\rho c_{v} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} =\\cdot(k \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}^2 T)+\\mathbf{\\Phi}} \\] 3 Euler and Navier-Stokes Equations Recall differential linear momentum equation: \\[ \\rho\\mathbf{g} - \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} p+ \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}} = \\rho\\frac{D \\mathbf{V}}{D t} \\] Equations of motion of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}}\\) is still needed, and its different depending on types of fluid 3.1 Euler equations (frictionless flow) Use the inviscid flow assumption, that is \\(\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}}=0\\), the momentum equation reduces to: \\[ \\color{purple} \\rho\\mathbf{g} - \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} p+ \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}} = \\rho\\frac{D \\mathbf{V}}{D t} \\] Fluids with low viscosity can be reasonably modelled as inviscid, except near boundaries. 3.2 Newtonian fluid 3.2.1 Strain Strains of a fluid particle evaluate the deformation due to an applied shear stress. and strain is defined as (anticlockwise positive): \\[ \\mathrm{strain_{xy}} = \\Delta\\theta_x-(-\\Delta\\theta_y) \\] In a continuous system, the rate of strain is then: \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\mathrm{strain_{xy}}) = \\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\] or in vector form: \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\nabla \\mathbf{V}+(\\nabla \\mathbf{V}^{\\top}) \\] 3.2.2 Viscosity Newton defined a newtonian fluid by a fluid in which the viscous stresses are linearly proportional to the local strain rates. \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}} \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon_{ij}} \\] In order to apply this to the Naiver–Stokes equations, three assumptions were made by Stokes: The stress tensor is a linear function of the strain rate tensor or equivalently the velocity gradient. The fluid is isotropic. For a fluid at rest, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}} = 0\\) (so that hydrostatic pressure results). And it leads to: \\[ \\color{purple} \\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\mu\\left(\\nabla \\mathbf{u}+\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}\\right)+\\lambda(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} \\] or \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}}=\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_{i}}{\\partial x_{j}}+\\frac{\\partial u_{j}}{\\partial x_{i}}\\right)+\\delta_{i j} \\lambda \\frac{\\partial u_{k}}{\\partial x_{k}} \\\\ \\] where, \\[ \\delta_{i j}= \\begin{cases}0 &amp; \\text { if } i \\neq j \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text { if } i=j\\end{cases} \\] As a result, expand the formula: \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\lambda \\frac{\\partial u_{}}{\\partial x_{k}} &amp; \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) &amp; \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right) \\\\ \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) &amp; 2 \\mu \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}+\\lambda \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} &amp; \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\\right) \\\\ \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right) &amp; \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right) &amp; 2 \\mu \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}+\\lambda \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\end{array}\\right| \\] And \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) represents the shear/dynamic viscosity and volume/bulk viscosity respectively, The value of λ, which produces a viscous effect associated with volume change, is very difficult to determine, not even its sign is known with absolute certainty. Even in compressible flows, the term involving λ is often negligible; however it can occasionally be important even in nearly incompressible flows and is a matter of controversy. When taken nonzero, the most common approximation is λ ≈ −2/3μ. 3.3 Navier-Stokes equations Substitute the stress representation into the linear momentum equation: \\[ \\rho\\frac{D \\mathbf{V}}{D t} = \\rho\\mathbf{g} -

Additional equations are state relations for the thermodynamic properties of the fluid. For example for perfect gas: \\[ \\rho=\\frac{p}{R T} \\quad \\hat{u}=\\int c_{v} d T \\] The system of equations is now well-posed and can be solved, subject to boundary conditions. 3.3.1 Incompressible system We have: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{V} &amp;=0 \\\\ \\rho \\frac{D \\mathbf{V}}{D t} &amp;=\\rho \\boldsymbol{g}-\\nabla p+\\mu \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{V} \\\\ \\rho c_{p} \\frac{D T}{D t} &amp;=k \\nabla^{2} T+\\mathbf{\\Phi} \\end{aligned} \\] Note that for incompressible flow, \\(\\rho,\\mu,k\\) are constants, only 3 unknowns are left \\(p, \\mathbf{V}, T\\). So the incompressible system is already closed. Besides, continuity and momentum equations are independent of the \\(T\\), thus decouple from the energy equation. 3.4 Boundary conditions Wall: these are typically solid, impermeable and there is a no-slip condition at the wall. Inlet: known velocity \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) and pressure \\(p\\) (and temperature \\(T\\)) 3.5 Stream function Stream function provides a mathematical tool to automatically satisfy the continuity constraint, after which we can then solve the momentum equation.

That is, The function \\(\\phi\\) is called a potential function. \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\times \\mathbf{V} \\equiv 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\mathbf{V}=\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\phi \\] Velocity potential \\(\\phi\\) is another scalar function, a complementary to the stream function \\(\\psi\\).It is applicable only in irrotational flow. Some useful properties: In Cartesian coordinate, it reduce the 3 velocity components \\(u\\), \\(v\\), \\(w\\) into a single scalar: \\[ u=\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\quad v=\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\quad w=\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z} \\] Line of constant \\(\\phi\\) is called potential lines. In two-dimensional flow, potential lines are everywhere orthogonal to the streamlines, because: \\[ u=\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\quad v=-\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\] The dot-product of their gradients are: \\[ \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i}+\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} \\mathbf{j}\\right] \\cdot\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i}+\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\mathbf{j}\\right]=u(-v)+u v \\equiv 0 \\] If \\(\\phi\\) exists, substitute the definition into the unsteady Bernoulli equation, \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}+\\int \\frac{d p}{\\rho}+\\frac{1}{2}|\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\phi|^{2}+g z=\\mathrm{const} \\] It is an equation between just two scalar quantities, \\(\\phi\\) and \\(p\\). 5 Vortex Motion and Applications Vortices are structures within the flow in which fluid is rotating about an axis line (which may be straight or curved). A vortex line is therefore defined as a line which is always in the same direction as the local vorticity vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\). Similar to streamline, vortex lines \\((x, y, z) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))\\) are obtained by solving: \\[ \\frac{dx/ds}{d\\xi_x}=\\frac{dy/ds}{d\\xi_y}=\\frac{dz/ds}{d\\xi_z} \\] Similar to steam tube, vertex lines which pass through a closed curve in space form a vortex tube. 5.1 Circulation Fluid circulation describes the strength of rotation, or strength of fluid swirling, within a closed contour \\(C(t)\\). Mathematically it is defined as the integral of velocity along the contour curve: \\[ \\Gamma=\\oint_{C(t)} \\mathbf{V} d s=\\int_{S} \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} d S \\] 5.1.1 Material elements and its motion Consider how a infinitesimal displacement \\(d\\mathbf{s}\\) deforms over a small time \\(dt\\), illustrated in the diagram below. We have \\(d(d\\mathbf{s})\\) the material line element: \\[ \\begin{aligned} d(d \\boldsymbol{s})=d \\boldsymbol{s}_{1}-d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0} &amp;=\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}+d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0}+\\mathbf{V}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}+d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0}\\right) d t\\right)-(\\boldsymbol{x}+\\mathbf{V}(\\boldsymbol{x}) d t)-d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0} \\\\ &amp;=\\left(\\mathbf{V}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}+d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0}\\right)-\\mathbf{V}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\right) d t \\\\ &amp;=d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial\\left(d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0}\\right)} d t \\\\ &amp;=d \\boldsymbol{s}_{0} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\mathbf{V} d t \\end{aligned} \\] Therefore: \\[ \\frac{D(d\\mathbf{s})}{Dt} = (ds\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\nabla})\\mathbf{V} \\] 5.2 Kelvin’s Circulation Theorem Kelvin’s Circulation Theorem status the expression of the rate of change of the circulation \\(\\frac{D\\Gamma}{Dt}\\) and determine how a circulation around a fluid loop varies as the loop moves with the flow. (reference) Apply material derivative to circulation we have: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{D}{Dt}\\Gamma&amp;=\\frac{D}{Dt}\\oint_{C(t)} \\mathbf{V} d \\mathbf{s} \\\\ &amp;= \\oint_{C(t)}\\frac{D}{Dt}(\\mathbf{V} d \\mathbf{s} ) \\\\ &amp;= \\oint_{C(t)}\\frac{D\\mathbf{V}}{Dt}\\cdot d \\mathbf{s} + \\oint_{C(t)}\\mathbf{V}\\cdot \\frac{D(d \\mathbf{s})}{Dt} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Substitute material line element into the last term to get a scalar inside the loop integration, then we have: \\[ \\frac{D}{Dt}\\Gamma = \\oint_{C(t)}\\frac{D\\mathbf{V}}{Dt}d \\mathbf{s} \\] Recall the general linear momentum equation and substitute the material derivative of velocity: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{D}{Dt}\\Gamma &amp;= \\oint_{C(t)}\\left(\\mathbf{g} - \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}p}{\\rho} + \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\tau_{ij}}}{\\rho}\\right)d \\mathbf{s} \\\\ &amp;= \\oint_{C(t)}\\mathbf{g}d \\mathbf{s} - \\oint_{C(t)}\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}p}{\\rho} d\\mathbf{s} + \\oint_{C(t)}\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}}}{\\rho}d \\mathbf{s} \\end{aligned} \\] This function is not zero unless: 1st term: body force torque is zero, body force is irrotational, \\(\\mathbf{g} = \\nabla\\phi\\), \\(\\phi\\) is a scalar. 2nd term: \\(p = p(\\rho)\\) or \\(\\rho = const.\\)(incompressible and isotropic) 3rd term: inviscid, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{ij}}=0\\) 5.2.1 Aerofoil lift and Kutta-Joukowski Theorem One application of the Kelvin Circulation Theorem is in explaining the lift attained by an aerofoil during the shedding of the starting vortex. Consider a stationary aerofoil shown in the diagram below. At time \\(t = 0\\), the aerofoil is stationary, there is no vorticity and around the path \\(C(t)\\) the circulation is \\(\\Gamma = 0\\). As the flow velocity increases, vorticity is shed behind the aerofoil leading to positive \\(\\Gamma\\). By Kelvin’s circulation theorem, the circulation \\(\\Gamma_0\\) around \\(C(t)\\) is independent of time. Therefore, there must be negative \\(\\Gamma_1\\) around the aerofoil, which leads to lift by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem (\\(L&#39; = −\\rho u\\Gamma\\)). 5.3 Helmholtz Theorems Suppose we have an inviscid, incompressible fluid of constant density moving under a conservative body force, then The quantity \\[ \\Gamma=\\int_{S} \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} d S \\] is the same for all cross-sections \\(S\\) of a vortex tube. i.e. the strength of a vortex is constant along the length of the vortex. A vortex filament cannot end in the fluid; it must extend to the boundaries of the fluid, infinity, or form a closed loop If fluid is initially irrotational, in the absense of rotational forces, it remains irrotational indefinitely. 5.3.1 Vortex rings A vivid example of Helmholtz’s theorems can be seen in vortex (smoke) rings. These are vortices in which the core vortex line forms a closed loop (theorem #2). Such vortices can retain their strength (theorem #1) and travel significant distances (the smoke is carried in the vortex).","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fluid dynamics","slug":"fluid-dynamics","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/fluid-dynamics/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Derivation of Integral Fluid Equations","slug":"Derive-the-NS-equation-from-scratch-AGAIN","date":"2022-05-12T09:39:18.000Z","updated":"2022-05-20T16:26:46.974Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/12/Derive-the-NS-equation-from-scratch-AGAIN/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/05/12/Derive-the-NS-equation-from-scratch-AGAIN/","excerpt":"Feeling unsafe when deploying CFD algorithms, the best way to alleviate the anxiety is to derive the fundamentals again.","text":"Feeling unsafe when deploying CFD algorithms, the best way to alleviate the anxiety is to derive the fundamentals again. 1 Control Volumes 1.1 Basic Physical laws of fluid Mechanics 1.1.1 Control mass &amp; Lagrangian frame of reference 4 terms &amp; 3 facts: A system (or control mass) is a collection of moving particles of interest.

A control surface closures the control volume Mass, heat and work can cross the control surface and mass and properties can change with time within the control volume. 1.1.4 Volume and mass rate of flow 3 key quantities of interest: Velocity \\(\\textbf{V}\\), Volume flow \\(Q\\) and Mass flow \\(\\dot{m}\\). Shown above, given a flow of fluid passing through an infinitesimal control surface (\\(S\\)) with an area of \\(dA\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the surface outward normal \\(\\textbf{n}\\), in time \\(dt\\), the volume of the flow can be expressed as: \\[ d \\mathcal{V}=V d t d A \\cos \\theta=(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) d A d t \\] Flow rate through surface can be integrated as: \\[ \\color{purple}{Q=\\int_{S} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathcal{V}}{\\mathrm{d} t}=\\int_{S}(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) d A} \\] Sign of \\(Q\\) is important, inflow = negative, outflow = positive. And the corresponding mass flow is: \\[ \\dot{m}=\\int_{S} \\rho(\\mathbf{x})(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) d A \\] In the special case that \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) remain constant in space, \\[ \\dot{m}=\\rho AV \\] 1.2 The Reynolds Transport Theorem The theorem refers to the relationship between (a) time derivative of a system property and (b) the rate of change of that property within a region of interest. Let \\(B\\) be the property (e.g. mass, energy, momentum) and \\(\\beta\\) be the amount of \\(B\\) per unit mass \\(\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}m\\), often called the intensive value. The Reynolds Transport Theorem stats that: \\[ \\color{purple}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\left(B_{s}\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\left(\\int_{C V} \\beta \\rho d \\mathcal{V}\\right)+\\int_{C S} \\beta \\rho(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) d A} \\] 1.2.1 concise proof Consider a fixed control volume with fluid moving through it shown as below. The control mass (particles) of interest move from the area surrounded by the solid circle to the area surrounded by dashed line within a time interval of \\(dt\\). The change rate of \\(B\\) of the control mass equals the sum of the change rate of B in the fixed control volume (\\(CV\\)) outflow of B from the fixed control volume (\\(CV\\)) inflow of B into the fixed control volume (\\(CV\\)) The condition fixed is critical, if the control volume is moving with a velocity \\(\\mathbf{V_{s}}\\), a reference system conversion is needed to set control volume fix, i.e. using relative velocity \\(\\mathbf{V_{r}}=\\mathbf{V}-\\mathbf{V_{s}}\\) Consider \\(b = \\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}m\\) Total amount of \\(B\\) in the fixed control volume (\\(CV\\)) is: \\[ B_{C V}=\\int_{C V} \\beta d m=\\int_{C V} \\beta \\rho d \\mathcal{V} \\] Correspondingly, the change rate of \\(B\\) within \\(CV\\): \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\left(\\int_{C V} \\beta \\rho d \\mathcal{V}\\right) \\] Sum of inflow and outflow of \\(B\\) toward \\(CV\\): \\[ \\int_{C S} \\beta \\rho(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) d A_{o u t} + \\int_{C S} \\beta \\rho(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) d A_{in} = \\int_{C S} \\beta \\rho(\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) d A \\] Though this equation seems intuitive, more steps are needed to prove this from the idea of limits. As a result, the Reynolds transport theorem is arrived. 2 Conservation of Mass and Momentum The Reynolds transport theorem (RTT) establishes the relation between control mass and control volume, we already have control mass laws in 1.1.2 Laws of Mechanics.

Paper link: Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows(newer version on arXiv) Useful links: Paper explanation video Official Github Abstract It is a general-purpose backbone, unlike ViT which only covers the classification task instead of detection and segmentation. Swin Transformer extends the jobs to all the vision jobs. Two challenges of using transformer on vision tasks: Large scale difference of vision entities (multi-scale) high resolution of pixels compared with words (former works use feature map, divide as patch, or self-attention in windows divided from the whole image, to reduce the sequence length) Main contribution is the Shifted window that brings the Hierarchy to ViT. It has several merits: greater efficiency, reduced sequence length cross-window connection is allowed with shifted window multi-scales linear computational complexity with respect to image size, instead of square (foundation for larger Swin Transformer V2, pretrained model on huge resolution) Many downstream tasks are tested including classification, detection and segmentation. One line is added to the abstract in this version, after MLPmixer in order to further prove the method of sifted window: shifted window is also beneficial for all-MLP architectures. Key figures ViT and Swin Transformer are compared in the above illustration, for ViT, the feature map is single and with low resolution (all *16 downsampling \\(patchSize = 16\\)). For Swin Transformer, the hierarchical feature map is introduced. Importance of multi-scale feature for detection and segmentation:For detection, take the most common FPN as an example, features from different layers of feature map of different reception field are collected to ensure the multi scale performance.For segmentation, take the common UNet as an example, the skip connection of different layers also provide a hierarchy of scales. Besides, ViT performs self-attention for the whole image, leading to the quadratic computation complexity. Swin transformer instead perform self-attention on the patches. The computational cost for each window is fixed for fixed patch size. As a result the computation complexity is linear. To some extend, swin transformer takes a lot of prior information of CNNs as: the locality inductive bias, i.e. the objects are locally consecutive. The full space self attention is kinda a wast of source. For CNN, pooling layers increase the receptive field of each layers, enabling them to catch features with different scales. The patch merging is a mimic of this operation. A bigger patch is merged by 4 smaller patch, so that the receptive field of the bigger patch is increased. The multi scale feature maps can feed a FPN for detection or UNet for segmentation, i.e. a general purpose backbone. It illustrates how the window is shifted in layers. The unit patch is the grey on with patch size = 4. In the next layer, the window is shifted 2 patches to the right and bottom. The main benefit of this is the ability of cross-window interaction. Without shifting, the self-attention operations are limited to non-overlap patches. The global information is inaccessible, broke the key idea of transformer. The memory can be saved with an ability to global modelling. 1 Introduction The motivation is to prove the ability of Vision Transformer as a general backbone. The mechanism is well illustrated from the key figures above. The good results are next presented. In future, a unified architecture will benefits both the CV and NLP world. Actually, Swin transformer leverages a lot vision inductive bias to perform well on vision tasks. The unifying is done better for ViT, as it does not change any of the transformer architecture. Very easy for multi modelling learning. 3.Method 3.1 Overall Architecture Feed forward process and patch merging method are mainly discussed. The key process of swin transformer is the patch merging. After merging, the width and height get halved while the length is doubled, just like the convolutional method. The dimensions of each layer is very similar to CNNs', identical to ResNet. Besides, in order to keep aligned with CNN, the CLS token used in ViT is deprecated. CLS token is an extra token along with the training tokens in ViT. It contains all the information from every can be directly trained in classification last. For swin transform, the last feature map is flattened into a list, and the result can be used for classification, detection and segmenting, just like CNNs. There is always a global average pooling layer after the architecture above. For example, if for image classification on ImageNet, the feather length of next two layers are: [1, 768] -&gt; [1, 1000]. 3.2 Shifted Window based Self-Attention As shown above, the image with \\(H \\times W\\) patches is divided into non-overlapping windows such a way that each window has \\(M \\times M\\) patches (\\(M = 7\\) for default). The self-attention is computed within each windows, instead of the whole image as in the standard one. The complexity difference between standard shelf attention (\\(\\mathrm{MSA}\\)) and window base self-attention (\\(\\mathrm{W}-\\mathrm{MSA}\\)) is further estimated: For an image with \\(h\\times w\\) patches: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\Omega(\\mathrm{MSA})=4 h w C^2+2(h w)^2 C \\\\ &amp;\\Omega(\\mathrm{W}-\\mathrm{MSA})=4 h w C^2+2 M^2 h w C \\end{aligned} \\] Note that \\(M = 7\\), the complexity decrease is huge. The complexity of the multiplication of two matrices with dimensions \\(a\\times b\\) and \\(b \\times c\\) is \\(a\\times b \\times c\\). After reducing the complexity, the shifting method is introduced to address the problem of cross-window communication, as shown in the key figures and overall architecture sections, a shifted window layer (\\(\\mathrm{SW}-\\mathrm{MSA}\\)) always follows a window layer (\\(\\mathrm{W}-\\mathrm{MSA}\\)). \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^l=\\mathbf{W}-\\mathbf{M S A}\\left(\\mathbf{L N}\\left(\\mathbf{z}^{l-1}\\right)\\right)+\\mathbf{z}^{l-1} \\\\ &amp;\\mathbf{z}^l=\\mathbf{M L P}\\left(\\mathbf{L N}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^l\\right)\\right)+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^l \\\\ &amp;\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{l+1}=\\mathbf{S W}-\\mathbf{M S A}\\left(\\mathbf{L N}\\left(\\mathbf{z}^l\\right)\\right)+\\mathbf{z}^l \\\\ &amp;\\mathbf{z}^{l+1}=\\mathbf{M L P}\\left(\\mathbf{L N}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{l+1}\\right)\\right)+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{l+1} \\end{aligned} \\] Below is some technical details with shifted window, not related to the main idea of swin-transformer. Recalling the illustration of shifted windows in key figures, the unlike the window layer, the shifted window layer has more resulting windows (9 instead of 4) with different scales ($2, 4, 4 $), it is impossible to compute efficiently in parallel. Another simple idea is padding, extra 0 is padded so that the scales of windows are identical. But the authors come up with a better one: The idea is cyclic shift, pretty much like the periodic boundary condition, the windows out of the \"boundary\" is glutted back from the left bottom of the image, and after the SW-MSA, a reversed operation is applied. However, unlike the real periodic boundary condition, the glutted windows are actually far from each other, no attention operations should be applied across these windows. In order to do this, the familiar masking technique is introduced As shown above, for window 2 and 1, only half of the resultant window is useful, the other half needed to be masked. And it is applied by add a mask matrix, where the useful and masked area are set to be \\(0\\) and \\(-100\\), respectively. After softmax, the infinite negative number results in 0. 3.3 Architecture variants Different \\(C\\) and block numbers of 4 stages differs the variants. Swin-T: \\(C=96\\), layer numbers \\(=\\{2,2,6,2\\}\\) -- ResNet50 Swin-S: \\(C=96\\), layer numbers \\(=\\{2,2,18,2\\}\\) -- ResNet101 Swin-B: \\(C=128\\), layer numbers \\(=\\{2,2,18,2\\}\\) Swin-L: \\(C=192\\), layer numbers \\(=\\{2,2,18,2\\}\\) 5 Conclusion Swin transformer is presented with linear increase of computational complexity. Good results are shown not only on classification, but in dense tasks such as detection and segmentation. Patch merging is introduced to percept a hierarchical of feature maps as in CNNs, better for resolving features with a range of scales of an image. A key element is self attention based on window followed by shifted windows, which is very help for dense tasks. As the extra shifted window mechanism breaks the potential of multi modelling learning. They are working on use this technique to NLP fields.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Contrastive learning review","slug":"paper-reading-contrastive-learning-review","date":"2022-05-02T17:21:04.000Z","updated":"2022-09-18T10:20:30.857Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/03/paper-reading-contrastive-learning-review/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/05/03/paper-reading-contrastive-learning-review/","excerpt":"As a form of unsupervised learning, contrastive learning plays an ever more important role in deep learning.

Here's a review of contrastive learning in CV since 2018, including 4 stages and 14 papers. This blog is written following the lead of this review video. This is a series of paper reading notes, hopefully, to push me to read paper casually and to leave some record of what I've learned. Since, 2018, the development of contrastive learning can be concluded in 4 stages, and an overview is shown below: Brief introduction Contrastive learning is a machine learning technique used to learn the general features of a dataset without labels by teaching the model which data points are similar or different. The idea is intuitive, given 3 pictures above; 2 cats and 1 dog. The goal of contrastive learning is to discriminate the cats from the dog by comparing the pixel similarity of them. Dive into the model, inputing \\(X_{cat1}, X_{cat2}, X_{dog}\\) to a neural network. The distance between the resulting latent features of the 2 cats \\(L(f_{cat1}, f_{cat2})\\) should approach 0 while those between the cats and the dog \\(L(f_{cat}, f_{dog})\\) should approach infinity. Contrastive learning is a very portable and flexible technique. It can be used anywhere as long as you can design a rule (preset task) to define which data are similar (positive sample) and which are different (negative sample). In the above example, one defines the pictures of the same species as positive, and those of different species as negative. Actually, although it is usually seen as an unsupervised technique, contrastive learning is not meant to be unsupervised. As we can see above, under that context (preset task), it is more like a supervised constrained clustering. The model still relies on labeled datasets containing pictures of each species. But people manage to make this technique unsupervised or self-supervised in CV by designing clever preset tasks. For example, the instance discrimination we are about to see below. Except from designing of the preset task, another key point is the design of loss function. The preset task sets the goal of training while the loss function defines how to do it. Unlike the loss functions that are often used in discrimination learning (cross entropy) or generative learning (L1-L2 loss), contrastive losses measure the similarity of each feature, which varies as the encoded features keep updating with epochs[5] . Different kinds of loss functions are developed by follow up papers to improve the training efficiency and stability. Stage 1: Wild growth(-2019mid) At this stage, preset tasks, loss function, model and research area are not unified. InstDisc[1] Preset task The figure above perfectly explains the motive and goal of the instance discrimination. Just as the name suggests, it extends the discrimination task from the previous class level to the instance level i.e. every single instance is a class. Method As shown above, InstDisc[1] proposes a CNN (ResNet50) based model that encodes a batch (batch size 256) of figures into a latent feature space(128D), where the distance between each figure are maximised. The way of training such a model is through contrastive learning. For one feature encoded from a particular image, the positive samples are the features encoded from the augmentations of the picture and the negative samples are obtained by sampling(4096) the set of features encoded from all the other images. In this way, the model becomes self-supervised. To modify the general example above, instance discrimination task can be illustrated as below. Besides, in order to save all the negative features without blowing up the memory, a memory bank is proposed. In every epoch, 4098 negative features are sampled from the memory bank. And the memory bank is updated with features in each epoch, under a method of proximal regularisation. Loss function Noise Contrastive Estimation(NCE) loss is applied to push away the negatives while clustering the positives.. Comment This paper proposes the fundamental preset task instance discrimination. Together with the NCE loss, a fine result is achieved. Besides, the idea of saving a bounden of negative samples with other data structures, the proximal regularisation (momentum updated memory bank) method inspires the following queue method and the momentum updated decoder[5] Even the super-parameter setting is also typical and a lot of work follows, including MoCo v1[5]. InvaSpread[2] Less influential as it is, this paper can be seen as a preliminary work of the SimCLR v1[6]. Unlike InstDisc[1]with additional structure to save negative samples, the positive and negative samples in InvaSpread[2] are from the same batch. And only one encoder is used to process the samples. Method The preset task is still instance discrimination, while the sampling is done in a different way. As shown above, assuming \\(x_1\\) as the original, the positive sample is \\([\\hat{x}_1]\\), while the negative sample is \\([x_2,x_3,\\hat{x}_2,\\hat{x}_3]\\), which means taking batch size as 256, the resulting positive and negative sample sizes are \\(256\\) and \\((256-1)*2\\) respectively. Recalling InstDisc[1], the negative sample is from outside this batch and the size can be much larger. Yet the downside part of it is that it requires another encoder for the negatives. Whereas, with positive and negative in one batch, only one encoder is needed and the model thus becomes end-to-end. The loss function employed is a variant of the NCL loss. Comment Together with the SimCLR series, these papers stand for another route of contrastive learning, which is featured by: End-to-end Only one encoder No reliance on extra data structures Positive and negatives are in the same batch This paper is very similar to SimCLR but has rather mediocre performance. There are several reasons: The batch size is too small - only 256, not enough negative samples (no TPU, no money) No powerful augmentations or the MLP projector that are proposed by SimCLR v1[6] CPC[3] Apart from instance discrimination, this paper proposes another pretext task - contrastive predictive coding, a reminiscence of the difference between discriminative and generative models. And this approach is generalisable enough to copes with audio, images, text, and even reinforcement learning. pretext task Given a temporal sequence, the encoded features of the sequence before time t are fed into an auto-regressive network (RNN or LSTM). The \"origin\" is defined as the RNN predicted features after time t \\(\\hat{z}_{t+1} - \\hat{z}_{t+4}\\), the positive sample \\(z_{t+1} - z_{t+4}\\), is defined as the features encoded from feature data \\(x_{t+1} - x_{t+4}\\). The negative samples can be flexible, a typical way is the features encoded from data other than \\(x_{t+1} - x_{t+4}\\). In this way, the input \\(X\\) can vary from picture patches, audio, video etc. CMC[4] CMC propose a more general way of defining positive sample, basically the different view of one instance can be defined as positive. Motivation It is perfectly presented in the abstract, here is just a paraphrase. In the real world, information from different angle of view such as smell, sight and touch describe one thing together. Though these sensory channels might be different, the high level features such as physics, geometry and semantics tend to be same. And this preset task aims to train a view-invariant model. Pre-text task As the figure above illustrates, the representations of the same scene, no matter which view, are set as positive while representations from different scene as negative. Loss function The contrastive Learning loss is designed to maximise the mutual information between features of different views. Comment CMC is one of the first works to apply contrastive learning to multi-view problems. It demonstrates the flexibility of contrastive learning, and the portability of applying it to multi-view problems. As a result, OpenAI developed the famous Clip[16] model, where the image and its language description are seen as a positive pair. One slight drawback of multi-view might be the need for different encoders to handle different views. For example, in Clip[16], ViT and a large scale language model are applied to process different modes. Yet, given the various applications of transformer, this drawback may be addressed by processing multi-model problems via one single transformer model. Here is a example of doing it - MA-CLIP[18]. Stage 2: Two heroes(2019mid-2020mid) Their are MoCo and SimCLR. In this stage, the development is very fast. The time intervals between each works introduced below are typically 1-2 months, even less than 1 month. And the SOTA on imageNet were refreshed every month. And the model architecture (encoder then projection), loss function(infoNCE), momentum encoder setting, more powerful method augmentation and more epochs tend to come together. And the result trend to the supervised learning accuracy. MoCo v1[5] It is the milestone of CV contrastive learning, and it is the first model that outperform supervised learning. It is a breakthrough that rise the confidence of unsupervised learning. Method As highlighted above, MoCo has two contributions: (1) momentum encoder (2) queue MoCo stands for momentum contrast. Compared with InstDisc[1], MoCo updates the encoder with momentum to prevent the encoder changing too rapidly between two batches. Besides, the application of queue instead of memory bank makes sure to update the negative dictionary efficiently. Further more, MoCo introduces another loss function called infoNCE, very similar to softmax. Comment Actually, the details of MoCo almost follows exactly the InstDisc[1], including backbone of ResNet 50, 128D of output size, L2-norm of outputs, 0.07 of loss temperature, the data augmentation setting, 0.03 learning rate and 200 epochs of training. It seems like MoCo is just make some improvements to InstDisc[1]. Nevertheless, MoCo is classic. The reason may be the effectiveness and the influential of the improvements. For example, the momentum encoder setting is inherited by following SimCLR [6], BYOL[10], even the latest work. Furthermore, the way of writing is just beautiful and the scope is much higher than an ordinary work. Instead of presenting those improvements that they made. The authors conclude the preliminary works as a task of dictionary look-up. Personally, I feel like I understand the contrastive learning only until I read through the introduction part of MoCO. SimCLR v1[6] SimCLR stands for Simple Contrastive learning, it is easy to understand and often used as example in many introduction blogs. The only drawback is the requirement of large batch size. Method It is very similar to InvaSpread[2], the positive size is \\(N\\) While the negative size is \\(2(N-1)\\) . The key contribution is a \"projection head(mlp with linear then RELU)\" after the shared encoder, only applied during the training process. The improvement results in a gain of the accuracy up to 10%. A loss function similar to infoNCE is used to maximise the agreement between positive and negative samples. Data augmentation ablation SimCLR does a detailed ablation test searching the most effective augmentation method, as it is crucial for the contrastive learning. As shown above all kinds of augs are listed and studied. And the result, as concluded in the heat-map below, shows the best 2 augmentation methods are crop and colour. Projection ablation Two piece of information in this result: The non-linear(linear with RELU) rise accuracy up by 10% The output size makes less difference to the accuracy, so afterwards works tend to choose small size as well. 128 is enough. Comments The full contributions compared with InvaSpread[2] are: More data augmentatinon Learnable projection head layer Bigger batch size More epoch The authors are as humble as admitting most of these contributions are not novel in the later part of the article. We note that almost all individual components of our framework have appeared in previous work, although the specific instantiations may be different. The superiority of our framework relative to previous work is not explained by any single design choice, but by their composition. However, similar to MoCo[5], the contributions of this paper are also very influential. For example, the projection head after the encoder is adopted in following MoCo v2[7] , SwAV[9]and BYOL[10]. And the data augmentation scheme is also widely applied. The the LARS optimiser for large batch size appears in BYOL[10] as well. And because of the good results of MoCo[5], and SimCLR, contrastive learning lead a dominant trend in deep learning from 2020. And ended until the proposing of Vision Transformer. MoCo v2[7] It is technically a technical report. They note the effectiveness of the projection head and data augmentation method that SimCRL presented. After just less than 1 month, they merge these techniques into MoCo resulting in new SOTA on ImageNet. Results From the ablation result above, it is notable that the acc gains 6% with only projection head. And a large number of epochs are useful. As a matter of fact, the trend of increasing epochs still keeps. Recall the new MAE, 1600 epochs are adopted and the accuracy keeps rising. Besides, they present MoCo v2 outperforms SimCLAR from two angle of views MoCo v2 is able to reach higher accuracy with less epochs The memory and time cost of MoCo is much lower to get a good result Comment MoCo v2 may be the most memory friendly method to get a good result with contrastive learning. And it still very useful. SimCLR v2[8] Actually most part of this paper focus on semi-supervised leaning. The SimCLR v2 part presented 3 points: Bigger backbone model size, 153-layer SKnet Deeper projection head, 2 layers MLP after a search of layer number Momentum encoder inspired by MoCo[6][7], but less effective. And they claim the reason is that the batch size of SimCLR is already big. SwAV[9] SwAV abbreviates for Swapped Assignment Views. This another multi-view work, aiming at predicting one view's feature from another view. And it combines contrastive leaning with clustering. Method Unlike the former contrastive task, instead of enacting contrastive loss between positive and sampled negative features, SwAV compares positive with all negative features via clustering and swap prediction. Multi-crop augmentation In additional to the great clustering setting, SwAV proposes another type of augmentation, multi-crop. With multi-crop, the model manages to learn information not only from large scale but small scale of an image, with similar computation cost. It can be seen that the multi crop improve the accuracy on all the approaches, especially on the clustering related ones. And this technique can be seen as a critical contribution to reach SOTA. And it is adopted by a lot following models. Result The result of SwAV not only surpasses the preliminaries, but afters. It keeps SOTA that a convolutional backbone achieves until ViT models appear. As shown above, with only linear probe (froze all but the last layer) the SwAV result is very near to the supervised baseline. And the result converges to the supervised result with the model size. Stage 3: No negative samples Basically around BYOL and at last SimSiam integrates all the contributions before and makes a closure for the CNN based contrastive learning era. BYOL[10] Bootstrap Your Own Latent is the longer version. Negative samples are critical for preventing model collapsing (same output regardless the input, loss always 0, learn nothing). In this new approach, no negative is required. Model The approach is simple, after classical momentum encoder, and momentum projector, another layer (same architecture with projection) is added to the positive line. Then the model is trained to predict the negative output with the output of the positive line. Analysis The result is truly surprising and it resulted in quite a topic. One of the most influencial analytical works is this blog: Understanding Self-Supervised and Contrastive Learning with \"Bootstrap Your Own Latent\" (BYOL). Name Projection MLP Norm Prediction MLP Norm Loss Function Contrastive Performance 5 Contrastive Loss None None Cross Entropy Explicit 44.1 BYOL Batch Norm Batch Norm L2 Implicit 57.7 Projection BN Only Batch Norm None L2 Implicit 55.3 Prediction BN Only None Batch Norm L2 Implicit 48 No Normalization None None L2 None 28.3 Layer Norm Layer Norm Layer Norm L2 None 29.4 Random — — — None 28.8 The blog author tried to reproduce the BYOL but got model collapsing all the time. So he checked the model and found the reason is one batch norm layer missing in his projection heads. And he did a series of ablation tests on batch normalisation and raise a hypnosis that BYOL leverage batch normal layers as a source of implicit \"negative\" samples. i.e. positive samples are not the only sample needed. the presence of batch normalisation implicitly causes a form of contrastive learning. BYOL v2[11] The previous blog made a huge influence and the conclusion was widely accepted, exceot the authors. As a result, another article was published entitled \"BYOL works even without batch statistics\" In this paper, a more detailed ablation experiment was applied. And it shows the batch norm works as it designed, just a method to improve the stability of training. Besides, the authors use a better initialisation (group normalisation) , and the model maintains a similar accuracy without any batch norm layer. SimSiam[12] After all these works, people found the contrastive learning's performance is accumulated by many techniques and tricks, a little too messy. In this context, He et al proposed a simple SimSiam network. As shown above, SimSiam is basically a BYOL excluding the momentum encoder. And a detailed comparison of results are provided, including classification and downstream tasks. Note that SimCLR and MoCo v2 performs the best on downstream tasks. Stage 4: Transformer based Because of the popularity of vision transformer[15], the backbones of the contrastive learning methods are substituted into transformer. And the works aim at analysing and solving the resulting unstable problem. MoCo v3[13] Although the title of MoCo v3 includes ViT, it is mostly a architecture that coping with all backbones. Method From the algorithm, the MoCo v3 is a combination of MoCo v2 and SimSam. From the big picture, a query encoder and momentum key encoder with the contrastive loss are inherited from MoCo v2, while in the detail, a prediction mlp layer after the projection layer, a symmetric loss function recall the SimSiam. Transformer based model instability Because of the popularity of ViT, they substitute the backbone as ViT and find instability in training process. As shown above, the training accuracy tend to drop severely then increase gradually especially with large batch size. In this condition, large batch size has a negative impact on accuracy. Trick To alleviate the fluctuation, they retrieves the gradients of each layer and find the huge gradient change always occur on first layer (tokenisation patching layer). As a result, they try froze the first layer after random initialisation, and the problem solved. Note that this trick is useful for both MoCo v3 and BYOL with ViT. DINO[14] Short for self-distillation with no labels, DINO is actually a follow-up work of BYOL. The student and teacher networks are same as the query and key network respectively. One contribution is the centring layer in the teacher network. And the algorithm is very similar to MoCo v3, same forward process with slightly different loss function.

The astounding result of unsupervised transfer learning and the capability of reconstructing highly masked (up to 90%) images might herald a new era in CV. This is a series of paper reading notes, hopefully, to push me to read paper casually and to leave some record of what I've learned. Paper: Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners Useful link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sq4y1q77t/ NLP CV Supervised Transformer[17] ViT[8] Self-supervised Bert[1] MAE Inspired by Bert[1] and ViT[8], MAE shows the capability of unsupervised learning on CV. It's not the first work to expand Bert [1] to CV, but it might be the most influential one. It might accelerate the application of transformer in CV, as Bert[1] has done with NLP. Notes Title Note the title format, \"Something is a good fellow\", is same as the GPT[2] series. It is a powerful format to include the distilled conclusion in the title. Abstract This paper proposes an asymmetric, transformer-based, denoising auto-encoder architecture. The unsupervised pre-training task is to reconstruct highly masked input images. The high masking ratio is the key. It reduces the pre-training time by 3 times and is able to train larger model efficiently, resulting in competitive reconstructing accuracy. The transfer performance is even better than the supervised pre-training models. Key figures First, the reconstruction results are shown below. Although the details are vague, the reconstruction of the main content is astonishing. Note that maybe not all of the validation images turned out as good as this, but this result is still really surprising. Conclusion The model is said to be simple(false) and scaled well(as long as you are rich). The results show that MAE makes scaleable unsupervised pre-training in CV applicable, a similar route to that of NLP[1][2]. Besides, they claim the semantic difference between text and image leads to different masking operations. Furthermore, they mention that the patch masking operation does not separate semantic entities, meaning one masked patch may include more than one piece of semantic information, unlike language. As a result the reconstruction results show that the model manages to learn from complex semantics. Introduction Although yielding excellent success in NLP, applying scalable unsupervised models in CV is still a challenging problem. But why? i.e. what makes masked autoencoding different between vision and language? 3 reasons are discussed: The architecture difference between convolution and transformer: it's hard to integrate masked embedding or positional embedding to the convolution layer (Actually positional embedding is not needed for convolutional layer) -- addressed by ViT[8]. The information density difference between text and image: Unlike high-semantic text, natural signals in images possess heavy spatial redundancy -- addressed by masking a very high portion of random patches. Decoder difference: in NLP, take BERT as an example, a simple linear projection is used as a decoder, while in vision, a simple decoder is not powerful enough to reconstruct the semantic level information -- addressed by substituting linear projection with transformer layers. Then, the idea of MAE is on the front door. The encoder processes only the unmasked patches, while the lightweight decoder reconstructs the whole image from the encoded latent representation and the [mask] tokens. With a very high masking ratio(e.g. 75%), the pre-training time can be reduced by 3 times. Besides, the data capacity and generalisation performance are great. SOTA accuracy is achieved with fine tuning on a medium-sized dataset (ViT-Huge model on ImageNet 1K). In this section, the reason why designing such an architecture is well presented through Q&amp;A, highly recommended. Sometimes, motive is an important factor in distinguishing a paper from a technical report. Relate work Works in 4 areas are briefly reviewed. Note that BEiT[9] is very similar to MAE, while BEiT[9] projects each patch to a label and predict as Bert[1], unlike projecting to pixels in MAE. Besides, the recently popular constructive methods [14][15][16] relay on data augmentation heavily, while MAE does not. Approach The architecture and the training approach is briefly covered in the sketch below: Additional details about the architecture: For per-processing, non-overlapped patching and random uniform masking are adopted. The [mask] token is shared, and another position embedding is introduced to the decoder input so that the inputs are different on different masked area. But it is unclear whether the positional embedding is performed only on the [mask] token or on the whole input, i.e. encoded patches + [mask] token. Furthermore, the lightweight decoder has &lt;10% computation per token compared with the encoder. Reconstruction target: The decoder aims to recreate the pixels of masked patches. The loss function is the mean squared error (MSE) between the output and the original image, only on the masked region of course. Besides, a variation reconstructing the normalised pixels shows an improvement in representation quality. Implementation: The random masking step is applied by shuffling and dropping the last part. And un-shuffling is used before the decoder to reconstruct the position. In this way, no sparse operation is needed and the cost becomes really low. ImageNet experiments Setup The model is self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K, then evaluated by 2 kinds of supervised training: (i) end-to-end fine-tuning and (ii) linear probing(only the last linear projection layer is allowed to update). ViT-Large (ViT-L/16)[8] is used as baseline backbone. Note that they reproduce the full supervised experiments by ViT[8] and get 8% higher accuracy. The trick is a strong regularisation(75%). May be it meets the previous theory of the semantic difference between picture and text. Supervised, original[8] Supervised, their impl. Self-supervised, Baseline 76.5 82.5 84.9 Ablation Most of the result are recoded clearly on the figures and tables below, Just add some details: Best mask ratio is higher than BERT[1] (15%) and iGPT[7], ViT[8]and BEiT[9] (25%-50%) The encoder manages to learn the semantic representations given that the semantic pieces are mixed in each input patches, different from NLP No saturation of linear probing accuracy is observed, indicating the overfitting is not severer even at epoch 1600 One explanation for (a): a reasonably deep decoder can account for the reconstruction specialisation, leaving the encoder to extract a more abstract latent representation. One explanation for (c): current architecture only process known patches, the introducing of unknown [mask] token would result in a gap between the pre-train task and inference task. Result of (d) indicates that high-frequency components are useful in MAE. And the dVAE token case is actually what BEiT[9] does, projecting each patch to a single token. Result of (e) distinguishes MAE from contrastive learning and related methods. In MAE, the random masking plays the main role of data augmentation. Comparison with unsupervised models: not only the accuracy is better, the pre-training time is shorter than the competitors as well with supervised models: it indicates that MAE can help scale up model sizes. And the MAE performance on ImageNet1K is similar to the model trained on the 300 times bigger dataset JFT300M. But, considering the number of class of JFT300M is much more than ImageNet1K as well, the result is slightly unfair. Partial Fine-tuning In addition to the full fine-tuning and 0 fine-tuning (linear probing), partial ones are applied by fine tuning fixing several layers. The result indicating at least the last 6 layers are task-related. Transfer learning experiments At last, down steam tasks are evaluated compared with other frameworks. Review Writing, simple but has a very good storyline. From the full introduction of the motivation, to the detailed clear figures explaining each part of the design. The algorithm is simple, just applying self-supervised learning to CV based on ViT[8]. 2 key points are introduced: More patches need to be masked Transformer decoder to reproduce the pixels instead of a simple linear layer projecting patches into tokens. In conclusion, a simple idea, a great result and detailed experiments make this paper a great work. Reference Devlin, J., Chang, M. W., Lee, K., &amp; Toutanova, K. (2018).

Paper: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale Useful links: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15P4y137jb https://theaisummer.com/vision-transformer/ Not only Vision Transformer (ViT) performs better on traditional CV tasks, it has more impressive properties. As shown above, Naseer et al. demonstrate the tasks where ViT shows extra performance over CNN models, even over humans. Notes Abstract While Transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT series, and T5 nail the NLP tasks, CV tasks remain dominated by CNN-based models. This paper applied a pure transformer encoder (same as BERT) to sequences of cut images and obtains a good classification result, especially with supervised pre-training on a large dataset then fine tuning on a mid-size dataset. Besides, fewer computational resources (meaning 2500 days of TPUv3) are need to attain good results, compared with CNN models. Conclusion Besides the paraphrasing part, the conclusion part discusses the future work based on the ViT. And all of them have follow-up works. Apply ViT to other CV tasks, given the promising performance of DETR. Only 1 and a half month later, ViT-FRCNN and SEDR mange to apply ViT on detection and segmentation respectively. And after 3 months, Swin Transformer introduces hierarchical feature to transformer, making ViT more suitable to vision tasks. Self-supervised pre-training, given the great results of BERT and GPT in the NLP field. Initial explorations in the paper show a gap from the supervised pre-training. One year later, MAE narrows the gap successfully by generative model. Besides, in the section of self-supervised learning, a contrastive learning is mentioned as well, and MOCO v3 and DINO follow this line. Further scaling up this model. Half year later, same group introduces Vit-G with two billion parameters, attaining new SOTA on ImageNet of 90.45%. Introduction Success of Transformer-based models on NLP tasks are firstly reviewed. And it is natural trying to apply such self-attention mechanism to vision. Yet here are one major obstacle: How to transfer a 2D picture to a 1D sequence? One intuitive thought is to flatten the picture directly and treat each pixel as an element. In this way, a medium size 224*224 picture will be converted to a 50,176 long sequence. However, the sequence length is quadratically related to model complexity. Morden hardware only supports input sequence length &lt;1000 of a pure self-attention model. For example BERT only accepts input length of 512. Yet the authors mange to incorporate the original transformer encoder in CV. In order to address the sequence length problem, they split the image into 16*16 patches, each patches denotes a sequence element (token). In this way, a 224*224 image can be converted as a sequence length of 16*16 with each element sized 14*14. Each element then gets linearised through a FC layer before being passed into the transformer encoder. And the afterwards experiments show that the new model doesn't perform well on mid-size model. One explanation is that transformer model lack the image-related inductive bias of CNN (locality and translation equalisation). Yet with pre-training on large dataset such as JFT-300 and ImagNet-21K, a better result than CNN can be approached. Related work It is a detailed related work covering all the aspects in the original paper. I just pick few of them. All the related works aim at reducing the sequence length within the limitation caused by self-attention. Some try to combine CNN with self-attention. For example Wang, X et al.'s work takes the feature map extracted by CNN as the input of transformer. Others try to replace the CNN with a special variation of self-attention. For example, Ramachandran et al.'s work replaces all convolutional sublayers of the ResNet-50 model with self-attention layers. To reduce the computational cost, a local region of the image instead of the whole image is used as the receptive field of the self-attention layer, meaning each pixel only attends to its neighbours in a restricted area. In another work line, Wang, H et.al's work factorising 2D self-attention into two 1D self-attentions to significantly reduce computation complexity. And there is a very similar Cordonnier et al's work also split the images before the self-attention layer. Yet the patch size is 2*2 and with the dataset only CIFAR-10. This paper enlarges the model, apply it in big dataset, and shows the scalability. Another related work image GPT(iGPT) trains a GPT-2 scale generative network. Yet the highest accuracy on ImageNet is 72%, way less than 88% of this paper. But in 2021, an afterwards generative network MAE shows a competitive result of 87.8%, with good transfer leaning capability on segmentation and object detection as well. Besides, works exploring transfer learning performance of CNN model on larger datasets such as ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M are mentioned. And this paper studies the transformer instead of the CNN. Method The whole big idea of the method part is leaving as much as possible the original transformer architecture in order to leverage the good feature and the existing mature efficient implementations of it. Vision Transformer (VIT) From the overview, and the algorithm it should be called Vision BERT instead of Vision Transformer, given the pure encoder architecture and the extra \"classification token\". Assume a 224*224*3 image, after patching, the sequence length is HW/P2=16*16=196 and the width is 14*14*3=768. Given the hidden size of the model D=768, through linear projection layer (E), sequence X [196*768] are multiplied with weight E [768*768]. The resulting linear output [196*768] is then contacted with [cls], followed by adding standard 1D learnable positional embedding to be the transformer input [197*768]. After several transformer blocks, the output size does not change and the [cls] token is projected to a softmax classification layer Ablation experiments The pre and post-processing are crucial for ViT given that the middle transformer encoder layers are kept as original. Multiple rounds of ablation experiments are carried out. Position embedding schemes, 2D embedding and relative embedding are applied to compare with the standard 1D embedding, and no evident gain is spotted. [cls] token vs average pooling, extra [cls] token is inherited from the Transformer model for text, and traditionally in CV, instead of an additional token, an average polling layer after the output layer is usually used as a classifier. The figure blow shows no both works. But in order to stick the original design as close as possible, [cls] token is applied. Another analysis after the model description: Inductive bias: Less locality, translation equivariance and 2D neighbourhood structure are possessed by ViT, compared with CNN. Hybrid Architecture: CNN can be used as a special embedding, leveraging the inductive bias of the CNN model. Limitation on Fine-Tuning Pre-train ViT at larger and higher resolution datasets is proved to be beneficial. Yet the input sequence lengths are different when training on two datasets with different resolutions, resulting in positional embeddings of different lengths. In this article, a 2D interpolation is applied to transfer a pre-trained positional embedding to another dataset to fine-tune. But the accuracy will loss if the resolution difference is too big. Experiments Setup ResNet, ViT, and the hybrid model are evaluated together and ViT wins taking account of the pre-training cost. Besides, a small self-supervision experiment is deployed and sees potential. Two scales of ImageNet(1k and 21k) and JFT(303M) are used as pre-training dataset. Only classification tasks are evaluated with popular datasets. 3 scales of ViT are designed with different patch size(inversely proportional to the amount of data). For example, ViT-L/16 means ViT-Large with 16 patches. Comparison to SOTA And the best results are shown below: Pre-training cost requirements Figure 3 and 4 shows the performance of the presented models on different sizes of per-training datasets. ViT preforms competitive only starts from dataset 21k, and very well only on huge dataset. Figure 5 shows the transfer performances versus pre-training costs on JFT-300M of several models. And it shows that ViT is cheaper than ResNet. Interestingly, the Hybrid model is competitive on low pre-training cost. Inspecting ViT Figure7 Left: The learned linear projection weight matrix E [768*768] is inspected by PCA, and the first 28 components(modes) are visualised as embedding filters. They look pretty much similar to the early layer filters(kernels) of CNN (for example, the first layer of a CNN shown by Brachnmann et.al). This similarity indicates that the linear patch embedding manages to represent the low-dimension structure of each patch. Figure7 mid: Position embedding visualisation first shows that the spatial information is captured well by the E matrix, given that the similarity matrix between patches matches well with the distance relationships of patches. Second, patterns across rows (and columns) have similar representations, indicating the embedding layer has successful learned the row-column relationship. Overall, the 1D positional embedding has learned the 2D structure, coherent with the ablation experiment result. Figure7 Right: The receptive fields of the multi-head attention layers are evaluated by the mean attention distance. Compared with CNN whose receptive field increases linearly with the depth, the ViT attends the whole picture from the first layer, leveraging the natural advantage of transformer. Self-supervision A preliminary exploration on masked patch prediction for self-supervision (mimicking one of the BERT pre-training tasks) has been employed. But the result is not satisfying. And contrastive pre-training are mentioned as a future work. Review This is a concise-written, fundamental article. Just as presented in the conclusion part, it inspired many flow-up works from any direction in the CV area, such as applying to more tasks, changing the architecture(tokenisation, transformer block(MLP-mixer： changing multi-head attention layers to MLP , meta-former: substituting multi-head attention layers to average pooling), changing objective function(self-supervised, contrastive learning), and multi modality. It's still unclear whether convolution, attention or MLP will win this game. Reference Naseer, M. M., Ranasinghe, K., Khan, S. H., Hayat, M., Shahbaz Khan, F., &amp; Yang, M. H. (2021).

Instead, I follow a reference video above directly and make notes together with it. History and Timeline Given that the GPT series are all developed by the OpenAI and the Transformer &amp; Bert are developed by Google, it seems there are two companies combating. And it is inevitable to compare these two series. From the perspective of number of cites, it is obviously that OpenAI have catch less attention from the academic world despite the huge cost. But it's not because GPT series are less novel, but because the goal of GPT series is bigger than that of Transformer &amp; Bert. Transformer is originally developed for Machine Translation task only. And Bert simply aims to push the pre-training technic forward. That's the reason why Bert performs better than GPT if the number of parameters are the same. As a result, GPT is harder and more expensive to train a decent model. And the size of model make others hardly to reconstruct it. From the companies' perspective, OpenAI does this because they want to build the strong AI, but Transformer &amp; Bert are developed only by the teams of Google. GPT-1 Abstract The whole idea is similar to what CV did in the last several decades, that is pre-training of a model on a massive dataset followed by fine-tuning on a small specialist dataset. Lacking of large labelled data such as ImageNet of 10 million, however, NLP can't do what CV does exactly. The scale of machine translation database might reach 10 million but one piece of image possesses almost 10 times of information than a sentence. So the database is still not big enough. GPT makes a big step by using unlabelled data for pre-training. And then aero shot on GPT-2 makes another big step. It is fair to say CV led the trend of deep learning in the first 5 years, but recent years, more new thoughts are coming from the NLP field. And these new thoughts have inspired the CV field as well such as ViT, CLIP and MAE. Besides, actually it had been a long time since NLP started to use unsupervised pre-training back then. For example, the word embedding model had been used for decades. But, the word embedding can only be seen as a layer, extra layers of model need to be designed to suit for various tasks. With GPT, however, the architecture doesn't need much change, only adjusting the input to suit the tasks is ok. The result is good but not as good as BERT, but the novelty of this paper is much better than BERT. Introduction After briefly introducing the word embedding, problems of pre-training more than word-level data are presented. For example the type of optimisation objectives and how to transfer the extracted information to the tasks. The main reason of this problem is the variety of NLP tasks. There is no way to suit all the needs together. Then this paper introduces a semi-supervised method which has been explained many times. But actually GPT and BERT are normally called self-supervised model. Though they are the same to me. Semi-supervised learning is a common concept in the Machine Learning. It refers learning from a mix of massive unlabelled data and a few labelled data. Then the architecture is described. Interestingly, in order to list the reason of choosing transformer over RNN as backbone. The authors say This model choice provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in text, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across diverse tasks. Besides, the paper accents the task-specific input adaptions, which is the key of this paper. Framework Unsupervised learning GPT uses a task that giving the data of un-k to un-1 to predict the un. So the likelihood function to be maximised is: \\[ L_{1}(\\mathcal{U})=\\sum_{i} \\log P\\left(u_{i} \\mid u_{i-k}, \\ldots, u_{i-1} ; \\Theta\\right) \\] Because the predicting task, the mechanism of the mask multi-head attention of transformer decoder matches the likelihood function perfectly. Because in the first layer of the transformer decoder, the data after u{i} are simply masked to be 0. And the whole pre-training process is like this: \\[ \\begin{aligned} h_{0} &amp;=U W_{e}+W_{p} \\\\ h_{l} &amp;=\\operatorname{transformer}\\_\\operatorname{block}\\left(h_{l-1}\\right) \\forall i \\in[1, n] \\\\ P(u) &amp;=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(h_{n} W_{e}^{T}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Compared with BERT, the biggest difference is never encoder or decoder, bidirectional or one-way along. The key is the pre-training task they choose, the completion task that Bert use is much easier than GPT's prediction task. Because this is the difference between interpolation and extrapolation. Therefore, BERT outperforms GPT on the same number of parameters. But the potential of the GPT series goes far beyond BERT. As a result, it took OpenAI years to develop such an impressive GPT-3 model. On another side, however, GPT's prediction task leads to a different architecture with BERT. And the decoder architecture makes the GPT model hard to be bidirectional from the start. We'll see how it conquer this. Supervised fine-tuning The fine-tuning task follows the standard supervise learning process as follows: \\[ L_{2}(\\mathcal{C})=\\sum_{(x, y)} \\log P\\left(y \\mid x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{m}\\right) \\] with \\[ P\\left(y \\mid x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{m}\\right)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(h_{l}^{m} W_{y}\\right) \\] And the authors find it helpful to optimise the L1 and L2 together as: \\[ L_{3}(\\mathcal{C})=L_{2}(\\mathcal{C})+\\lambda * L_{1}(\\mathcal{C}) \\] Task-specific input transformations The last thing to do is how to apply this framework to different tasks. Similar to with BERT, the pre-trained transformer block doesn't have to be changed. Experiments The dataset GPT trained on is BooksCorpus dataset, and the model has 12 layers with Hmodel = 768, same as BERTbase. Although the transformer encoder has one layer less than the decoder, GPT and BERT's numbers of parameters are still at the same level. Yet BERT has a 3 times larger BERTlarge model than the base. Because in addition to the BookCorpus dataset, BERT uses one more dataset for pre-training, in total the dataset is 4 times larger than GPT's. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al., 2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). And unfortunately, the average accuracy of BERTbase is higher than GPT at this time. Besides with the BERTlarge model , the accuracy can go higher, as shown below in BERT's paper. GPT-2 After GPT-1 got defeated by BERT in 4 months, of course, GPT-2 aims to fight back and beat BERT to the ground. Considering the decoder path can't shift to the encoder with dignity, the simplest way then is to enlarge the model and the dataset. But what if it's still not working? Abstract After developing a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText, and training on a new1.5B parameter model. The result turns out to be no significant difference with BERT. So they bring out another sell point, zero shot. Actually, the zero-shot behaviour is mentioned in the last section of GPT-1's paper in order to understand more of the unsupervised pre-training mechanism. And in GPT-2, this behaviour is brought front to increase the novelty. Introduction Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a problem setup in machine learning, where at test time, a learner observes samples from classes, which were not observed during training, and needs to predict the class that they belong to. Zero-shot methods generally work by associating observed and non-observed classes through some form of auxiliary information, which encodes observable distinguishing properties of objects.[1] The main-steam approach is one dataset - one task instead of one dataset - multiple tasks because of the generalisation that state of art models lack. Yet multitask learning (trending 2000-2010) represents the idea of training one model with a combination of multiple datasets and different loss functions. So GPT-2 takes the idea of multitask learning and trains the model with the zero-shot setting, under which the downstream tasks can be handled with no collecting of supervised data or fine-tuning. The result is competitive and promising according to the authors. Approach The model architectures of GPT1 and GPT2 are pretty much the same. But the input methods are different. In detail, recalling that during fine tuning process, the GPT1 introduces extra tokens such as [start], [Delim] and [Extract] to modify the input. But in GPT2 without the supervised fine-tuning process, these extra tokens would cause confusion. As a result, the downstream task input need to be more likely to the natural language when constructing. As a result, the authors introduce what we are used to calling it \"prompt\", here are the examples: For example, a translation training example can be written as the sequence (translate to french, english text, french text). Likewise, a reading comprehension training example can be written as (answer the question, document, question, answer). And afterward, 2 ideas for why this would work are discussed. First, if the model is powerful enough, it might be capable of understanding the prompts. Second, in such a big dataset, this kind of data structure exists. Take machine translation as an example, there should be many sentences containing \"translate to French\", English text, and French text. The authors point out some of them below. Examples of machine translation ”I’m not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in French: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I’m not a fool]. In a now-deleted post from Aug. 16, Soheil Eid, Tory candidate in the riding of Joliette, wrote in French: ”Mentez mentez, il en restera toujours quelque chose,” which translates as, ”Lie lie and something will always remain.”“I hate the word ‘perfume,”’ Burr says. ‘It’s somewhat better in French: ‘parfum.’If listened carefully at 29:55, a conversation can be heard between two guys in French: “-Comment on fait pour aller de l’autre coté? -Quel autre coté?”, which means “- How do you get to the other side? - What side?”. If this sounds like a bit of a stretch, consider this question in French: As-tu aller au cinéma?, or Did you go to the movies?, which literally translates as Have-you to go to movies/theater? “Brevet Sans Garantie Du Gouvernement”, translated to English: “Patented without government warranty”. Training data After considering the need for larger data and the disadvantage(noise) of the existing dataset, they developed a new dataset. The data is collected by first crawling 45 million links discussed on Reddit, and then extracting all the contents of these pages. The dataset contains 8 million documents, 40 GB of text. Experiment With 4 level of model, the one-short performances on 4 downstream tasks are shown blow: It can be seen that first 3 tasks, the results are not the best yet not the worst, however, the performance on Question Answering is bad, and other works perform way better than GPT-2. But this is not over, because in the figure, there is still room for performance improvement on all 4 tasks as the size of the larger model increases. So here comes GPT-3. GPT-3 The value of an article depends on the topic, effectiveness and novelty. GPT-2 has rather low effectiveness but strong novelty. As a result, GPT-3 aims to promote the effectiveness of its predecessor, while loosing the zero-shot condition to few-shot condition. Abstract The parameters of GPT-3 are enlarged 10 times to 175 billion. When applying GPT-3 to downstream tasks, strong performance is achieved without gradient update or fine-tuning. Besides, GPT-3 is capable of generating articles that are indistinguishable from humans' work. Besides, unlikely to former papers, this is a 63-page technic report. Without limitation of words or page number, it is very detailed, especially for the experiment and discussion sections. Introduction There are 3 problems of current pre-training + fine-tuning language model: A large labeled dataset is still needed for a good result The pre-training model is not really generalisable because of the need for fine-tuning Human doesn't need large fine tuning dataset When introducing their work, the authors try to re-define the concept of \"meta-learning\" and \"in-context learning\". What they really mean are training a huge generalisable model and train without updating the gradient, respectively. Then 3 evaluation methods are presented: Few-shot learning: 10-100 task-related data One-shot learning Zero-short learning And the performance with model size is plotted below (1.3B matches the GPT-2 model). Can be seen the final accuracy (few shot - 175B) almost doubled the former GPT-2 accuracy (1.3B zero-short) Approach In this section, fine-tuning, few-shot, one-shot, zero-shot learning are explained first in this figure below: The right column denotes the traditional fine-tuning process that requires extra few gradient update steps. The left side shows how GPT-3 applies \"in-context learning\" during inference. Basically, the input is divided by 3 parts, task description, example, and prompt. The task description and prompt are ended by \":\", and \"=&gt;\" respectively. The Transformer Decoder extracts the features of the \"context\" and then predicts the next several words starting from the prompt. As a result, the model is able to infer without gradient updates. Yet it comes 2 problems with few-shot: Unable to process really long examples. For example, thousands of English-French translation dataset is easy to get access but they can rarely be leveraged to promote the model performance. The inference is one-time thing, meaning the model can't actually learn from previous task description or example. Same samples have to be inputed again an again. As a result, the few-shot learning is not commonly used. Model and Architectures GPT-3 uses the same architecture as GPT-2 yet uses the methods form \"Sparse Transformer\" to modify the layers. And 8 different size of models are developed. Yet compared with previous models, GPT-3 is \"fatter\" ,meaning with same dmodel (192x of GPT3small), nlayers is smaller (only 8x of GPT3small). The mini-batch size goes up to 3.2M, definitely not mini. Large batch size improves the computational performance and parallelism while reducing the noise in each batch and making the model easier to overfitting. However, this defect is not evident in GPT-3. It is still an open question, now people consider it from two aspects: (1) the internal structure prevents the model from overfitting. (2) Such a large model is able to search for large space and it is more prone to converge to a simpler architecture. The learning rate decreases with batch size increasing according to research1 and research2, also counter-intuitive. Former work shows that batch size should increase linear with the learning rate. Training Dataset With a huge model, Common Craw dataset has come back as an option. The authors clean this dataset in 3 steps: A logistic classification model is built, taking samples of Common Craw dataset as negative and WebText as positive. Such model is used on the whole dataset of Common Craw to predict positive (high quality) or negative. The positive stay and the negative are filtered. LSH algorithm is applied on the remaining dataset to filter the similar content. More \"clean\" datasets are mixed in with weight. Training Process Specific training details are not presented. Information so far is DGX-1 cluster is used. Results The results are too many so only interesting figures are covered. From the figure, the power law distribution of performance with compute are found, i.e. in order to decrease the validation loss linearly, the FLOPS need to increase exponentially. This still is a major problem in Machine Learning. This figure shows the compression of results with Zero-shot SOTO and human. Nothing to comment. Just ... good. And on the Open-Domain QA tasks, GPT-3 outperform other models such as google T5. Google T5 can be considered as a model with both encoder and decoder. And few shot learning outperform SOTO fine tuning models. In the machine translation task, it is interesting to see that other language to English is better than English to others. Then a news article is generated with GPT-3 with numbers, years and time that makes the article look legit. Limitations Text synthesis, the predicted texts are always looping. The bidirectional limit still exist because of the decoder structure. The tokens that learned by GPT3 are equally weighted, yet wasting the model on the meaningless but high frequent function words. No experience in Videos or real-world physical interaction. The interpretation is still low. It's nearly impossible to know how does such a big model works.

Paper link: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding Useful links: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PL411M7eQ ​ https://youtu.be/UYPa347-DdE ​ Deep contextualized word representations - arXiv Notes by sections 0. Abstract The name of BERT might come from one of its important related work, ELMo. And Elmo and Bert are both characters in a TV show Sesame Street. The abstract focus on the two related work, ELMo and GPT. The bidirectional feature is in contrast to the unidirectional GPT model. And the \"without substantial task specific architecture modifications\" feature compares with the RNN-based ELMo model, whose architecture might get modified when training downstream tasks. Yet the ELMo model is bidirectional and GPT model is easy to use. When claiming a model is great, it is good to provide both the absolute accuracy and the relative accuracy compared with others. Just like this paper does. 6. Conclusion To summarise, this is a classical A+B type of research. The idea of BERT is simple, combine the advantages of the bidirectional network with a rather old RNN base (ELMo), and the unidirectional network with a transformer base (GPT). And in detail, 2 pre-training tasks are designed. The main contribution of this network is showing that bidirectional information is important. 1. Introduction From the history introduction, it turns out BERT is not the first to apply pre-training on NLP. It's been a while. But BERT makes it popular. 2. Related work 2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised data This is what the CV area does most often. Yet it is not effective in NLP. It is partly because of the lacking of data. Another reason might be the existing labeled data focus only on language inference and machine translation, which are too different from other NLP tasks. So BERT and GPT use unlabelled data to pre-train and prove that unsupervised pre-train on a massive data is more effective than supervised pre-train on a relatively small data set. And, interestingly, this trend in NLP gradually effects the CV world. Nowadays unsupervised fine-tuning is becoming more and more popular in CV area. 3. Bert In the first part, the pre-training and fine-tuning framework is briefly covered. A paper should be self-consistent, meaning that if a mechanic is fundamental in your area and essential to your work. It is a good habit to briefly introduce it, even if all the people in the area know it. Model Architecture And the architecture is as simple as just take the encoder part of the transformer model. number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H, and the number of self-attention heads as A. BERTBASE(L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) and BERTLARGE(L=24, H=1024, A=16, Total Parameters=340M). Because the hidden size of each multi-head attention sublayer is set as 64. And in transformer tradition, H = A * 64. So the multi-head number A actually depends on the hidden size H. As a result, the way of calculating the number of parameters is shown below. Input/Output Representations Why Bert need a pair of sentence to handle downstream tasks such as Machine Translation, unlike its predecessor Transformer? Because in Transformer, the input is a pair of sequences, taken by encoder and decoder respectively. But Bert is only an encoder. In English-Chinese Translation task for example, for transformer, the encoder take the English version and the decoder take the Chinese version, for Bert, the English version and Chinese version are glued with a special token [sept] then be inputed to the model. Besides the [sept] token, another embedding is introduced into the embedding layer, the sequence model. Details are shown below. 3.1 Pre-training BERT The paper provides an example of each task in Appendix section Masked LM and the Masking Procedure, just go for it and have a look if don't understand. Next Sentence Prediction The next sentence prediction task can be illustrated in the following examples. Input = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] he bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP] Label = IsNext Input = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP] Label = NotNext The \"flight ##less\" is because of the WordPiece embedding method that Bert uses. \"##\" means this token is split from last token, in this case, flightless is the original token. Because flightless is rarely used, the WordPiece embedding split this word into two. 3.2 Fine-tuning BERT Bert's architecture has one advantage over the transformer's, the self-attention allows model look both the two sentences. And the encoder-decoder model can't do that. As a result, the fine-tuning can be a little bit hazy. 4 Experiments 4.2 SQuAD v1.1 We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32. This misleads the people for a while. People found when fine-tuning with Bert, the variance of each results are high i.e. the result of fine-tuning is unstable. Then people found it is because 3 epochs are not enough. Besides, the optimiser that the original Bert model used is an incomplete version of Adam which is not stable for small epoch number. And the follow-ups change it into the original Adam. From the processes of the 3 experiments, it can be seen it is easy for BERT to be applied to downstream tasks. Just need to modify the input data in the form of the Bert sequence, and add another output layer. As a result, with BERT, massive number of tasks can be trained under a rather simple architecture. 5 Ablation Studies It is obvious the 4th architecture BiLSTM is from the idea of ELMO. And all the variation lead to a deterioration of the acc, especially in the MRPC task. Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) Dataset Created by Dolan et al. at 2005, the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) Dataset contains pairs of sentences which have been extracted from news sources on the web, along with human annotations indicating whether each pair captures a paraphrase/semantic equivalence relationship., in English language. Containing 5,8 in Text file format. In the Effect of model size part, they claim with a large model size, huge improvement can be reached. And this leads a trend of increasing the model size in NLP, for example, the 100 billon GPT-3, and 500 billion model Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation (MT-NLG). The boundary of NLP will be push further. Reviews Writing: The biggest sell point in this paper is chosen as the \"bidirectional\". From today's view, the contributions of BERT are so more than this. Besides, when say to choose a feature, it is better to discuss both the pros and the cons of the choice. For example, compared with GPT, the encoder is used instead of the decoder. The pros are the bidirectional feature, but the cons is the resulting difficulty in applying on generative tasks such as the machine translation. Besides, BERT follows a whole ideal path of solving deep learning problems. That is after pre-training on a deep and huge model on a huge unlabelled dataset, the model can be applied to many small tasks with a few steps of fine tuning.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Introduction to GNN","slug":"paper-reading-A-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-networks","date":"2022-04-14T05:58:38.000Z","updated":"2022-06-09T10:24:16.117Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/14/paper-reading-A-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-networks/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/14/paper-reading-A-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-networks/","excerpt":"This is a tech blog written by google research team in 2021 that introducing the graph neural network.

As a result, a throughout reading of the original blog is recommended. And as a result this notes are only in pieces. Graph-level task In a graph-level task, our goal is to predict the property of an entire graph. For example, for a molecule represented as a graph, we might want to predict what the molecule smells like, or whether it will bind to a receptor implicated in a disease. The example is actually a simple task example, and the loops can be detected with ordinary algorithm such as: Fast and Slow Pointer: Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. But with more complicated task, GNN can be useful. And here is the related Leetcode question: No.141: Linked List Cycle. This is reminiscent of standard convolution: in essence, message passing and convolution are operations to aggregate and process the information of an element’s neighbors in order to update the element’s value. In graphs, the element is a node, and in images, the element is a pixel. However, the number of neighboring nodes in a graph can be variable, unlike in an image where each pixel has a set number of neighboring elements. When introducing the message passing method, this blog makes an analogy with the convolution. And in addition to the however part mentioned in this blog, another difference is that in convolution, each element's value is weighted differently while in the aggregation method they are all the same. Interestingly, similar weights can be achieved with Graph Attention Networks, which is introduced in later section. Another way of communicating information between graph attributes is via attention. For example, when we consider the sum-aggregation of a node and its 1-degree neighboring nodes we could also consider using a weighted sum. A common scoring function is the inner product and nodes are often transformed before scoring into query and key vectors via a linear map to increase the expressivity of the scoring mechanism. Reviews Writing: the whole article is well coherent and fluent, building the knowledge of GNN step by step, from a highly simplified model to the real GNN. The beautiful interactive figures make the article easy to read and digestible. Yet lacking mathematics and codes is both pros and cons. Unfortunately, tarting today Distill will be taking a one year hiatus, which may be extended indefinitely. Graph neural network: a graph is a powerful tool so that all kinds of data can be described as a graph. But this power leads to a huge difficulty in optimisation. One reason is the sparsity, the dynamic structure makes it difficult the train on CPU or GPU. Another is that GNN is very sensitive to hyper-parameters, just like the experiment section of this blog shows. As such, it is an active research area yet rarely deployed in industry.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"Transformer","slug":"paper-reading-transformer","date":"2022-04-12T15:31:21.000Z","updated":"2022-06-09T10:25:21.668Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/12/paper-reading-transformer/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/12/paper-reading-transformer/","excerpt":"The transformer is the most important achievement in the last 5 years.

Paper link: Attention is all you need Useful link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pu411o7BE Notes by sections 0. Abstract According to the abstract, this work is first presented in the small field of machine translation, but because of the strong ability of generalisation. The transformer architecture has been extended in other fields such as CV and video. 6. Conclusion In the last part of the conclusion section, the future of transformer is partly predicted by the authors, though most of these future work is done by other researchers. 1. Introduction Firstly, traditional RNN, or GRU has been introduced. Then after a brief description of the sequential nature of RNN based models, the main problems of them are presented. That is, poor ability of parallelising, and poor long-range dependencies. Later after the introduction of the attention framework and how to combine attention into RNN, transformer is presented. 2. Background First, with the goal of gaining the ability to parallelise, the authors look back on using CNN for sequential data. With CNN, parallelising ability is in its nature and with multiple channels, multiple features can be learned through training. Likewise, the transformer is also parallelisable and Multi-Head Attention is designed with the ability to learn multiple features. But additionally the transformer is easier to learn dependencies between distant positions. Afterwards, related work on self-attention and memory network is mentioned. And both the connections and distinctions with transformer are elaborated. 3. Model Architecture After introducing the basic idea of the encoder-decoder architecture, the key transformer architecture diagram is given. And each part of the model is briefly described. (The diagram in this blog below is not the original, but a combination of 3 diagrams in the paper.) 3.1 encoder decoder stacks Encoder: In addition to briefly describing the encoder architecture, the authors mention that in order to avoid the projection step on the residual connection layers, the same input and output dimension is chosen in each sublayer, which is different from what CNN normally does. And this simple design yields the super parameters of the encoder to 2: Nx - the number of the \"encoder block\" and d_model - the feature dimension of the output layers. And this design makes the follow-up work such as bert, GPT-3 simple as well. Here is one thing that has been ignored: the definition of layer norm. Unlike batch normalization, Layer Normalization directly estimates the normalization statistics from the summed inputs to the neurons within a hidden layer so the normalization does not introduce any new dependencies between training cases. More is on https://paperswithcode.com/method/layer-normalization Decoder: Because in the prediction mode, the decoder is self-regressing, meaning that when predict y_t, only x_0 to x_t are available. However, the self-attention layer is able to attend to all the data i.e. x_0 - x_n. To prevent this, a masked multi-head attention layer is introduced so that when predict y_t, x_t+1 - x_n are masked. 3.2 Attention Similarly, after running over the definition of attention mechanism, the 2 modifications: scaled dot-product attention and Multi-head attention are described. As we all known, there are two methods (attention scoring functions) of calculating the similarity of query and key(attention weights over the value). One is additive attention. It is complex but allows different length of key (dk) and query (qk). And Additive attention layer includes learnable parameters that can be tuned during training. Another one is dot-product attention, it is simply dot product of the transverse query and key matrix. It requires same length of query and key and no learnable parameters are introduced. scaled dot-product attention It pretty much is the dot-product attention multiply with a scaling factor of 1/√dk. And it is because for large dk, the deviation of the dot-product results might get too large, and the according gradient can get extremely small and hard to train. But look the figure 2 of the paper, an optional mask node is shown in the computation graph. And the algorithm of mask is not described in detail. Basically when calculating q_t, in the mask node, the attention scores a_t+1 - a_t are substituted to a huge negative so that after softmax, the attention weight is 0 on values v_t+1 to v_n. And it is corresponding to the how the decoder works in the prediction mode. multi-head attention How mutli-head works is introducing clearly in the paper: linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values The question is why doing that. First, no learnable parameters in the dot-product attention, and second, to mimic the CNN extracting the features from different perspectives. Applications of Attention in our Model It is well shown on the whole architecture figure. In the figure it consists of 2 self-attention block and 1 attention block, where key-value is from the encoder and query is from the decoder. 3.3 Position-wise feed-forward networks It is a simply an MLP with one hidden layer. And the hidden size is 4 times of the input and output size. 3.4 Embedding and softmax One point is they multiply the weights by√d_model. And first same reason with before, and second, with scaled weights, the scale matches the scale of positional encoding described below. 3.5 Positional Encoding Different with RNN, transformer architecture reads no sequence information. And the authors add the positional information in the input data. 4 Why Self-Attention Basically it explains the table 1 below: It might be the case but it's not been accepted by some researchers. And the restricted self-attention is rarely used. The table shows that if n and d are the same, self-attention, RNN, and CNN possess the same complexity per layer, but self-attention outperforms them on the sequential operations and the max path length. But actually, a huge mount of layers and parameters and data are required for a self-attention model achieving a similar result as RNN and CNN. And nowadays all models based on the transformer are very expensive. 6 Results 6.2 Model Variations From Table 3, we can see the hyper parameters are not so much, and this simple design benefits the follow-ups. For example Bert and GPT. Reviews Writing: It is concise and neat. But if the possible, it's better to describe why of doing it, and show more thoughts on the model to make the paper \"deeper\". Model: Transformer change the NLP filed just like how CNN change the CV filed. Through after transformer based model such as BERT, it is possible to pretrain a huge model to rise all the NLP performance. Besides, in other fields such as CV and audio, transformer becomes a great rising point. And the fact that transformer may suitable for all the deep learning tasks gives a new thought of muti-model learning. Maybe a general model able to extracting video, pictures, audio into a same semetic space is coming soon. Yet, despite the great experiment performance, we still can't fully understand why transformer works. For example, attention is not all one need, because the residual connection and MLP are all critical. We still don't know why. Why without explicitly model the sequence or the space, transformer outperform RNN and CNN. One explanation is that it is because transformer's inductive bias is more relaxed than either recurrent or convolutional architectures. And that is why huge amount of data are needed for transformer to achieve a good result.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"ResNet","slug":"paper-reading-ResNet","date":"2022-04-09T12:42:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-09T10:25:07.255Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/09/paper-reading-ResNet/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/09/paper-reading-ResNet/","excerpt":"Since its introduction in 2015, ResNet and its variants have accounted for 50% of deep neural networks in use.

Abstract An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset Not only the 1st place results on several tasks but the potential to train a 1000-layer network made this Residual framework a huge attention. Unfortunately, due to the 8-page limitation of CDPR, and the massive number of results to be presented, there is no room for the conclusion section in this paper. Key figure This is the key figure showing that the degradation in accuracy caused by the depth in plain networks has been well addressed in ResNet. 1. Introduction This section first presents the need of training deeper neural network. And the first obstacle that encountered during this process is non-convergence cause by gradient vanishing / explosion, and it has been well addressed by normalised initialisation and intermediate normalisation layers. And the main focus of this paper is the second obstacle i.e. deeper networks have difficulty converging to lower losses and may perform worse than networks with fewer layers. And they addressed this obstacle by introducing the Residual learning framework as shown in the pic below. And this framework is easy to implement in caffe, the most popular DL framework back to 2015. Afterwards experiments results are briefly mentioned. The introduction section played as an expanded version of the abstract and the residual method is mainly focused, which is helpful for readers to catch the essence of the whole paper. 2. Related work Residual representation Actually the concept of residual is more common in the fields of statistics and machine learning. For example in linear regression, the residual denotes the distance between the estimated and the actual results (residual=y- y ̂ in 2D). And the iterative process of calculating the regression line aims to minimise the mean square of the residual loss. In addition, the well-known GB gradient boosting algorithm for machine learning is also based on the residual loss. Because this paper mainly focus on computer vision, so these early work isn't included. Shortcut connections It looks like this paper combines these two well-studied approaches with amazing results. First ideas are not necessary to make a paper a classic. Just like the quote on the Google Scholar homepage: stand on the shoulders of giants. 3. Deep Residual Learning Let us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be fit by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net), with x denoting the inputs to the first of these layers. First is the meaning of H(x), underlying mapping is actually intuitive but it confused me for a while, so here's the answer below: What does the phrase 'underlying mapping' mean? - Data Science Stack Functions map domains to ranges. Neural networks learn such functions, so you can think of a neural network as a mapping of input spaces to output spaces. Deep neural networks are stacked with many layers of course, and each of those can be viewed as sub-functions of the network with their own underlying mappings. For example, each layer in a convolution network consists of some convolution layers + some other helper layers such as normalisation and pooling. Next the paper brings up 2 methods to address the shape difference between X the input and H(x) the output for one particular layer that may occur. Option (A): 0 padding and Option (B): 1*1 convolution to project the channel and pooling with stride to adjust the height and width. 4. Experiments Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts After introducing the well known architectures, the 2 methods to address the shape difference are also studied. 3 groups are studies, Option (A): 0 padding, Option (B): projection when necessary, Option (C): projection to all layers. And because of the increasing of parameters caused by the projection, it is not surprise to discover C is better than B than A. And Option (B) is the winner considering both the performance and the efficiency. Deeper Bottleneck Architectures In ResNet18 and ResNet 34, the standard architecture is fine. But for deeper network, in order to decrease the flops, the bottleneck architectures is deployed. Basically in each residual block, decreasing the number of channel by 1*1 convolution first then expend the channel back to the number of input channel. As can be seen in Table 1, the flops of ResNet34 is similar to that in ResNet50. But this is only theory, in practice ResNet50 is obviously more expensive because of the inefficiency of computing 1*1 conv. Exploring Over 1000 layers Networks with layer numbers from 20 to 1202 are applied on dataset CIFAR-10 (With only output size 32*32 compared with &gt;300*300 on ImageNet, the networks are slightly modified). And the results shows that even with an aggressive depth on a tiny dataset, no difficulty of optimisation occurs. Yet shown on Table6, the test set classification error goes up compared with the shallower models because of the overfitting. Some Reviews This is a model with relatively simple idea and the authors have a great writing skill to make this paper neat and clear. The main contribution of this paper is introducing the residual block and skipping connection in deep learning. Although the authors intuitively explain and provide some experiments, the explanation is not currently accepted by the mainstream. Today, the reason why ResNet can achieve better results than ordinary networks is mainly because of its property of preventing vanishing gradients. The ordinary network without the residual framework cannot be trained in the later stage of training. It's still an open question why the 1000-layer network has low level of overfitting on a simple dataset. The same question is good performance on large networks such as the transformer series. One explanation is that despite the large network size, the intrinsic model complexity is low.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"AlexNet","slug":"paper-reading-AlexNet","date":"2022-04-07T14:25:50.000Z","updated":"2022-06-09T10:24:20.197Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/07/paper-reading-AlexNet/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/07/paper-reading-AlexNet/","excerpt":"It has been 10 years since AlexNet has been brought out.

A good paper needs new thoughts for the model, or at least some explanations, while this paper only presented how they applied 3 tricks and how good their results are. However, there was no doubt an influential hit in the area of computer vision, which has a passion for refreshing the top list. And this influence spread to other areas gradually with deeper studies on it. Notes by sections 0. Absturct To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. In addition to a brief introduction to the model, the use of GPU is also mentioned in the abstract. And works around GPU are mentioned all the time. It was really a tough engineering job from the perspective of the first writer. But it is not important for an acdemic paper. Besides, since the emergence of CUDA in 2007, the application of GPU in the ML field in 2012 is not uncommon, and MATLAB is mainly used as a ML tool with a large number of GPU acceleration libraries. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry At last, the result in the ILSVRC-2012 competition is as good as knocking the second to the ground and then showing off with a set of backflips. So personally it might look like a technical report, but it's still an outstanding paper and absolutly worth reading. 7. Discussion In stead of conclusion, this paper leaves a discussion as the last section, which is unsual. For example, removing any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the network. So the depth really is important for achieving our results The depth is important, but it is insufficient to be simply concluded from the degradation caused by removing one middle layer, ignoring other effects such as superparameter settings. And, considering only the conculsion, a more complete one might be, depth and width are both very important. The ratio of height and width matters. To simplify our experiments, we did not use any unsupervised pre-training even though we expect that it will help Before AlexNet, it was common to warm up the NN with massive unlabelled images before the actual training i.e. use an unsupervised model as an initial. And the goal of the field of machine learning was to extract the features of data through large-scale unsupervised models. However, this sentence steered the entire field from unsupervised to supervised learning, which, according to the machine learning pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun, was a \"wrong route\". But with the rise of the pre-trained language models such as Bert, and the contrative learning model in CV field such as MoCo, the unsupervised route is gradually comming back to the foreground. Ultimately we would like to use very large and deep convolutional nets on video sequences where the temporal structure provides very helpful information that is missing or far less obvious in static images. Actually video sequences are still a tough area beacause of the high computational comsumpution and the copyright issues. Key figure The right part is the most important result in this paper, though it isn't been discussed much in this paper. Actually it shows the last layer feature vectors perform really well in the semantic space i.e. deep neural network is very suitable to extract features from data. 1. Introduction To improve their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use better techniques for preventing overfitting. The paper leads one route of deep learning, which is, with large dataset and model, developing powerful regularization methods to prevent overfitting. However there is a new route, which is focusing on designing good architecture s.t. the overfitting won't happen with large model. Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. These two are the innovative points. People can then follow their work later, which makes this paper a cornerstone. 2. Dataset We did not pre-process the images in any other way, except for subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. So we trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels. There is one more point that is not emphasized. Previously, features of an image (such as SIFT) were always used as input instead of raw RGB values. Datasets such as ImageNet provided SIFT of their image set as well. The end-to-end nature is the selling point of a series of deep learning papers that follow. 3. Architecture 3.1. ReLU From a present point of view, ReLU is not that important for speeding up the training process. Other activation functions still work. It's the simplicity of ReLU that makes it stick. 4. Reducing Overfitting A metaphore of overfitting: In order to get a high score on an exam, you memorize all the answers to the exercises instead of understanding the question. 4.1 Data Augmentation The second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in training images. Specifically, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the ImageNet training set. PCA is here use as a augmentation method which follow-up work don't follow. For example, in ResNet a standard color augmentation is used with no fancy methods. And nowadays, standard color augmentation wins. 4.2 dropout There is, however, a very efficient version of model combination that only costs about a factor of two during training. The recently-introduced technique, called “dropout” Here dropout is considered a light version of model ensembling, but later study below has shown that the effect of dropout is actually equivalent to weight decay/regularization, yet there is no specific weight decay method equivalent to it algorithmically. one way to obtain some of the benefits of dropout without stochasticity is to marginalize the noise to obtain a regularizer that does the same thing as the dropout procedure, in expectation. We showed that for linear regression this regularizer is a modified form of L2 regularization. For more complicated models, it is not obvious how to obtain an equivalent regularizer. 5. Details of learning we trained our models using stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 128 examples, momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 0.0005 momentum, weight decay with SGD has become a standard method afterwards. We initialized the weights in each layer from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.01 (0, 0.01) is usually chosen as the initialization parameter pair in most standard-sized models. (0, 0.02) is in use even for large models like Bert. We trained the network for roughly 90 cycles through the training set of 1.2 million images, which took five to six days on two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs. Similar to what is happening now with training NLP, maybe it will drive the next evolution in hardware. And probably hardware similar to TPU would be popular. 6. Results 6.1 Qualitative Evaluations The kernels on GPU 1 are largely color-agnostic, while the kernels on on GPU 2 are largely color-specific. The kernels on GPU 1 are largely color-agnostic, while the kernels on on GPU 2 are largely color-specific Interesting problem but less focused by follow up work. consider the feature activations induced by an image at the last, 4096-dimensional hidden layer. If two images produce feature activation vectors with a small Euclidean separation, we can say that the higher levels of the neural network consider them to be similar. This is an intuitive work as talked before, and follow up work such as Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks dig deeper trying to interperate the NN. And interpretion is very important for works related to physics or fairness. Reference Srivastava, N., Hinton, G., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., &amp; Salakhutdinov, R. (2014).

Introduction Learning rate is one critical parameter in alliterative algorithms, including PDE and ODE solving, optimization, and eigenvalue calculation. In the deep learning area, the learning rate is more than critical because of the notorious difficulty on Stochastic gradient descent. Strictly, there are two ways of adjusting the learning rate: learning rate scheduling: adjust the global learning rate during iteration adaptive learning rate: adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on their gradients updates(moments), also called adaptive gradient or gradient descent optimization. In this article, learning rate schedule is mainly discussed. Afterward, \"learning rate\" refers to the \"global learning rate\". Methods of learning rate scheduling Apart from the constant learning rate, there are several ways to schedule the learning rate: change with epoch numbers learning rate decay: linear, step... learning rate down then up: stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts(SGDR) and Cyclical Learning rates(CLR) warmup change on some validation measurements: plateau learning rate decay Under the upper concepts of decaying the learning rate while training, how to choose a specific decay policy is personal. It can be continuous or step, linear or polynomial, exponential or trigonometric. In articles, stepped learning rate decay is more often used as the default choice. For example, Zagoruyko, S., &amp; Komodakis, N set the initial learning rate as 0.1 and drop it by 0.2 every 60 epochs on their modified version of ResNet. And this version of learning rate decay is set as the control group to compare with the SGDR strategy later in Ilya Loshchilov &amp; Frank Hutter's work. And in practice, the cosine annealing policy is a common choice today and can be used either alone or in combination with warmup and SGDR. Explanation Because of the presence of stochastic noise, the entire gradient descent process is not straightforward. With a constant learning rate, as shown in the gradient contour map below, the minima can not be reached with a constant step (blue) due to the relatively small steps at the bottom. And a lower minimum can be reached if the learning rate descends with the gradient i.e. epoch(green). #### SGDR and CLR ##### SGDR Stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts(SGDR) is firstly proposed to Deep learning in Ilya Loshchilov &amp; Frank Hutter's work. They introduced a policy of reinitializing the learning rate every certain number of epochs. Applying cosine annealing learning rate decay during each resulting \"mini-run\", the results perform fascinating. As shown in the charts, compared to 2 default step learnin rate decay policies, they enacted several SGDR policies with different T_0 and T_mul. T_0 refers to the epoch interval of the first \"mini-run\" and the epoch interval is multiplied by T_mul after each restart. As a result, at the ith \"mini-run\", T_i = T_0*T_mul^(i) And they suggests a SGDR policy with a small T0 = 1 or 10 at start, and set Tmult = 2 to double the epoch interval after every restart. And they claim by this policy, at least 2× to 4× fewer epochs are required to achieve a comparable result than before. ##### CLR A similar method called cyclical Learning rates(CLR) is proposed later by Leslie N. Smith, where 2 kinds of triangular and exponential CLR policies are demonstrated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with most kinds of mainstream CNN modules. Similarly, compared with a default fixed learnin rate, the demonstrats that their policies outperforms in accuracy and efficiency on several datasetes. one obtains the same test classification accuracy of 81.4% after only 25, 000 iterations with the triangular2 policy as obtained by running the standard hyper-parameter settings for 70, 000 iterations. ##### explanation Because of the nonconvexity, it is common sense that reaching a global minima is impossible. With a standard learning rate decay, a saddle point, or unstable local minima is more likely to trap the descending process as shown below. But cyclical Learning rates(CLR) and stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts(SGDR) would allow the process to “jump” from one local minimum to another regularly until a stable one. Still there are several choices, but Cosine Cyclical and Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts are more common. #### learning rate warmup Learning rate warmup is first applied in the famous Resnet paper in one of its experiments. In this case, we find that the initial learning rate of 0.1 is slightly too large to start converging5 . So we use 0.01 to warm up the training until the training error is below 80% (about 400 iterations), and then go back to 0.1 and continue training. And later Goyal and He's work makes a major influence, where constant and gradual methods of warmup are discussed. And gradual warmup is proved to be effective on large minibatch size. As we discussed, for large minibatches (e.g., 8k) the linear scaling rule breaks down when the network is changing rapidly, which commonly occurs in early stages of training. We find that this issue can be alleviated by a properly designed warmup [16], namely, a strategy of using less aggressive learning rates at the start of training. In practice, warmup are always combined with other learning rate methods afterwards. And linear warmup is a default method. #### Reducing the learning rate on plateau Apart from methods scheduling the learning rate with epoch, a dynamic learning rate decay method is also an option. It denotes the process of decaying the learning rate only when the optimizer fails to improve the accuracy or decrease the loss in serval epochs. For example, in AlexNet, The heuristic which we followed was to divide the learning rate by 10 when the validation error rate stopped improving with the current learning rate. The learning rate was initialized at 0.01 and reduced three times prior to termination. In Resnet after the warm-up, The learning rate starts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus Apply learning rate scheduling in PyTorch torch.optim.lr_scheduler provides several methods to adjust the learning rate based on the number of epochs. For example, def train_ch6(net, train_iter, test_iter, num_epochs, lr, device): print(&#x27;training on&#x27;, device) net.to(device) optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=lr) scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, num_epochs*len(train_iter)/10, eta_min=1e-9) loss = LSR(0.1) for epoch in range(num_epochs): net.train() for i, (X, y) in enumerate(train_iter): X, y = X.to(device), y.to(device) optimizer.zero_grad() y_hat = net(X) l = loss(y_hat, y) l.backward() optimizer.step() scheduler.step() Apart from well defined lr_scheduler , torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR allow us to apply self define scheduler such as: print(&#x27;training on&#x27;, device) net.to(device) optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=lr) t=10*len(train_iter)#warmup T=num_epochs*len(train_iter) lambda1 = lambda epoch: (0.9*epoch / t+0.1) if epoch &lt; t else 0.1 if 0.5 * (1+math.cos(math.pi*(epoch - t)/(T-t)))&lt;0.1 else 0.5 * (1+math.cos(math.pi*(epoch - t)/(T-t))) scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda=lambda1) # plot learningrate_decay lr_plot = [] for _i in range(num_epochs): for _j in range(len(train_iter)): optimizer.step() lr_plot.append(optimizer.param_groups[0][&quot;lr&quot;]) scheduler.step() plt.plot(lr_plot) Should we do scheduling with adaptive learning rate method? From Should we do learning rate decay for adam optimizer?, I found it as a arguable question. It depends. ADAM updates any parameter with an individual learning rate. This means that every parameter in the network has a specific learning rate associated. But* the single learning rate for each parameter is computed using lambda (the initial learning rate) as an upper limit. This means that every single learning rate can vary from 0 (no update) to lambda (maximum update). It's true, that the learning rates adapt themselves during training steps, but if you want to be sure that every update step doesn't exceed lambda you can than lower lambda using exponential decay or whatever. It can help to reduce loss during the latest step of training, when the computed loss with the previously associated lambda parameter has stopped to decrease. In my experience it usually not necessary to do learning rate decay with Adam optimizer. The theory is that Adam already handles learning rate optimization (check reference) : \"We propose Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory requirement. The method computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients; the name Adam is derived from adaptive moment estimation.\" As with any deep learning problem YMMV, one size does not fit all, you should try different approaches and see what works for you, etc. etc. Yes, absolutely. From my own experience, it's very useful to Adam with learning rate decay. Without decay, you have to set a very small learning rate so the loss won't begin to diverge after decrease to a point. But in the article Decoupled weight decay regularization(AdamW), it is encouraged. Adam can substantially benefit from a scheduled learning rate multiplier. The fact that Adam is an adaptive gradient algorithm and as such adapts the learning rate for each parameter does not rule out the possibility to substantially improve its performance by using a global learning rate multiplier, scheduled, e.g., by cosine annealing. In the CLR article, the authors encourage the combination of CLR methods with Adam as well. Adaptive learning rates are fundamentally different from CLR policies, and CLR can be combined with adaptive learning rates, as shown in Section 4.1. I All in all, theoretically, the adaptive learning rate methods such as Adam adjust the learning rate for each parameters under a upper limit as the global learning rate, which can be adjusted by scheduling. In practice, at least SGDR and CLR have been proved to be useful combining with optimizers. Experiment: Adam vs Adam + SGDR In this little experiment, the best setting in the last article is set as baseline, with Adam with constant learning rate. Leave other settings, Adam with cosine annealing learning rate, and AdamW with cosine annealing learning rate are compared. global learning rate = 0.005 scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts(optimizer, T_0 = **int**(num_epochs***len**(train_iter)/10), T_mult=1, eta_min=1e-9) As shown in the line charts, SGDR lift both the training and test accuracies. And the overfitting of the baseline method is alleviated as well. In the second and sub-figure, the fluctuation in the process of gradient descend caused by the cosine learning rate is obvious. And after each learning rate restart, the rate of the descend also gets a restart. And it takes fewer epochs than to get the same accuracy than the baseline. Reference Kingma, D. P., &amp; Ba, J.

Recently, I joined a Kaggle image classification competition, I used the pretrained ResNet50 plus other tricks and here is to record some of them I've learned for now. Introduction: from hard label to soft label In deep learning, the neural network is basically a super powerful non-linear regression machine aimed to fit a function between the input and the label. And the result is always called label. Hard label, in another word: the one-hot vector, is the most commonly type of label that is used. For example, in this Kaggle image classification competition, to digitalize the different name of the leaves, it is intuitive to encode the leaves categories as: 0, 1, 2, 3. And the factorized target labels would be somehow like [1,3,0...] where each element stands for the categories of the data. With the resulting category dictionary, it can be easily decoded after the training. Actually, there is a slightly difference in the binary world. What usually do is, the previously factorized label will be extended to be a 2-dimensional \"on-hot\" matrix where the elements stands for the probability of each class. And the network is aimed to train itself to make inference label nearest to the target label. Soft label is just slightly deteriorate the strong one-hot label into a weaker one. Simple explanation: How loss function lost information? In the cross entropy loss function, where y_inference and y_grountruth stands for inference and target label, n stands for the number of class. With the one-hot label, the components are 0 except for the true category. In a other word, the y_inference of the wrong category is not considered at all i.e. the information of the wrong category is lost. Which is against the real word classification. Effectiveness: Visualization In When does label smoothing help? Hinton shows the feature map difference between without and with LSR: When label smoothing is applied, the clusters are much tighter because label smoothing encourages that each example in the training set is to be equidistant from all other class’s templates. With hard targets, the clusters for semantically similar classes (for example different breed of dogs in ImageNet), are isotropic whereas, with label smoothing, clusters lie in an arc as shown in the third row. If you mix two semantically similar classes with a third semantically different class, the clusters are still much better than the ones obtained with hard targets as shown in the fourth row. Experiment: apply in competition Label smoothing can be easily applied in Tensorflow, but there is no such thing in PyTorch. So overwrite the Cross-entropy loss function with LSR (implemented in 2 ways): class LSR(nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;NLL loss with label smoothing. &quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, smoothing=0.0): &quot;&quot;&quot;Constructor for the LSR module. :param smoothing: label smoothing factor &quot;&quot;&quot; super(LSR, self).__init__() self.confidence = 1.0 - smoothing self.smoothing = smoothing def forward(self, x, target): logprobs = torch.nn.functional.log_softmax(x, dim=-1) nll_loss = -logprobs.gather(dim=-1, index=target.unsqueeze(1)) nll_loss = nll_loss.squeeze(1) smooth_loss = -logprobs.mean(dim=-1) loss = self.confidence * nll_loss + self.smoothing * smooth_loss return loss.mean() loss = LSR(0.1) class LSR2(nn.Module): def __init__(self, e=0.01,reduction=&#x27;mean&#x27;): super().__init__() self.log_softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1) self.e = e self.reduction = reduction def _one_hot(self, labels, classes, value=1): &quot;&quot;&quot; Convert labels to one hot vectors Args: labels: torch tensor in format [label1, label2, label3, ...] classes: int, number of classes value: label value in one hot vector, default to 1 Returns: return one hot format labels in shape [batchsize, classes] &quot;&quot;&quot; #print(&quot;classes&quot;, classes) one_hot = torch.zeros(labels.size(0), classes) # labels and value_added size must match labels = labels.view(labels.size(0), -1) value_added = torch.Tensor(labels.size(0), 1).fill_(value) value_added = value_added.to(labels.device) one_hot = one_hot.to(labels.device) one_hot.scatter_add_(1, labels, value_added) return one_hot def _smooth_label(self, target, length, smooth_factor): &quot;&quot;&quot;convert targets to one-hot format, and smooth them.

Then apply the LSR and run 50 epochs, with learning rate 0.005 and batch size 256, the result turns to be: It is a exciting improvement, but more tricks still in need. Conclusion 3 disadvantaged of the hard label: the relationship between the true label and the others is neglected, tend to be overfitting the model is tend to be over confident i.e. less generalizable more sensitive to label with noise, wrong labeled for example. Several good things about label smoothing: data augmentation by add more information, compensates for the lack of supervisory signals Improves generalizability Improves noise robust lower the feature norm Improves model calibration Bad things about label smoothing: label smoothing can't give real relationship between labels. It simply adds random noise, under fitting might happen under certain scenarios. If distill in use, the teach network preforms worse when apply label smoothing, more explanation in When does label smoothing help?

I switch to other theme. Preliminary Why personal blog Keeping a technical blog can be a great way of documenting your growth as a developer. This documentation can be particularly useful on a professional level. All software companies want to hire smart, thoughtful, communicative developers who can easily assimilate into a team, and who are ready to both teach and learn Static vs dynamic blog there are 2 types of mainstream personal blog: static and dynamic. Static is recommended considering its simplicity, 0 maintenance and 0 safety worry. Static blog Dynamic blog Price low, 0 cost when the traffic is relatively low High, server is needed, cloud server of high performance is usually very expensive. Features Limited, only third-party services can be used to complete certain \"dynamic\" functions, such as comments Rich, in WordPress for example, basically any kind of plugins can be found. Featuers such as auto-resizing, media players, multiple authors, scheduled posts, user analysis can be easily realize. Speed Fast Slow Maintainance 0 Need to care about the sever Markdown Supported yet it's the only choice not supported Geeky YES No And I also chose static because I'm geeky (poor of money) and results-driven (lazy to spend time on maintaining).

Search engines like Google read this file to more intelligently crawl your site. A sitemap tells Google which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files: for example, for pages, when the page was last updated, how often the page is changed, and any alternate language versions of a page. 1.install sitemap plugins $ npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save $ npm install hexo-generator-baidu-sitemap --save 2.add to the _config.yml in the blog root # hexo sitemap sitemap: path: sitemap.xml baidusitemap: path: baidusitemap.xml 3.Deploy the blog, go to https://daydreamatnight.github.io/sitemap.xml and https://daydreamatnight.github.io/baidusitemap.xml to see if sitemaps are uploaded 4.Go to Google Search Console, in the left panel, click Sitemaps, enter your sitemap URL sitemap.xml Googlebot won't download the sitemap immediately. Give it time. add robots.txt A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page. A robots.txt file is used primarily to manage crawler traffic to your site, and usually to keep a file off Google, depending on the file type: User-agent: * Allow: / Allow: /archives/ Allow: /tags/ Allow: /categories/ Allow: /about/ Allow: /guestbook/ Allow: /others/ Disallow: /js/ Disallow: /css/ Disallow: /lib/ Sitemap: https://daydreamatnight.github.io/sitemap.xml Sitemap: https://daydreamatnight.github.io/baidusitemap.xml deploy the blog and wait. check if sitemap is available After uploaded several updates, my sitemap still didn't fetched by google. So I went to check, it turns out my url setting in _config.yml is wrong. So I changed it to be my home url. And check it with URL Inspection Tool. 1.Open google search console, add the url of sitemap in the upper url inspecting box. It's normal it shows URL is not on Google because it shouldn't as a sitemap. 2.click live test to check the availability. It should be available, then just wait. index Bing to this Blog 1.go to Bing webmaster and login 2.connect with google webmaster. index baidu to this Blog(not possibly working) go to the baidu search console , Click 添加网站 and input every thing, do similar thing add sitemap just wait forever, this could take 2000 years, so give up Add copyright statement 1.open file themes/yilia/layout/_partial/article.ejs add before &lt;% if ((theme.reward_type === 2 || (theme.reward_type === 1 &amp;&amp; post.reward)) &amp;&amp; !index)&#123; %&gt; &lt;!-- add copyright statement --&gt; &lt;% if(theme.declare)&#123;%&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/declare&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125; %&gt; &lt;!-- end --&gt; 2.create new file declare.ejs under themes/yilia/layout/_partial/post/ with: &lt;!--add copyright statement https://github.com/JoeyBling/hexo-theme-yilia-plus/commit/c1215e132f6d5621c5fea83d3c4f7ccbcca074a3--&gt; &lt;% var sUrl = url.replace(/index\\.html$/, &#x27;&#x27;); sUrl = /^(http:|https:)\\/\\//.test(sUrl) ?
